  {"id":"abolins-abols2016ee","abstract":"The life-history trade-off between self-maintenance and reproduction posits that investment in one function decreases investment in the other. Manipulating the costs and benefits of functions involved in a trade-off may alter this interaction. Here we ask whether investment in self-maintenance during a stress response alters territorial behavior in wild Dark-eyed Juncos and whether rural and urban birds, which are known to differ in the magnitude of the stress response (greater in rural), also differ in the degree to which stress reduces territorial behavior. In rural and urban habitats, we measured territorial behavior using song playback, followed by either an acute stressor (capture and collection of a blood sample) or a nonstressful control situation. The following day, we again measured territorial behavior, predicting greater reduction in territorial behavior in individuals exposed to the stressor but a lesser reduction in territorial behavior in the urban as compared to the rural environment. We further assessed individual and population differences in response to stressors by measuring flight initiation distance, breath rate, and corticosterone levels in the blood. The rural population had a higher physiological and behavioral stress response than the urban population, and acute capture stress had a lasting (24 h) negative effect on territorial behavior, but only in the rural habitat. However, individual-level differences in measures of the stress response did not explain variation in the impact of stress on territorial behavior. Our findings show that stressors can have a negative effect on territorial behavior, but that this effect may differ between populations that vary in their stress ecology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Abolins‐Abols","given":"Mikus"},{"family":"Hope","given":"Sydney F."},{"family":"Ketterson","given":"Ellen D."}],"citation-key":"abolins-abols2016ee","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.2347","ISSN":"2045-7758","issue":"18","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ece3.2347","page":"6546-6555","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Effect of acute stressor on reproductive behavior differs between urban and rural birds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.2347","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"abolins-abols2018jeb","abstract":"Skip to Next Section\nOrganisms are expected to invest less in reproduction in response to a stressor, but theory predicts that this effect should depend on the frequency and duration of stressors in the environment. Here, we investigated how an acute stressor affected testes function in a songbird, and how chronic stressors influenced the acute stress response. We exposed male dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) either to chronic or minimal (control) disturbance during testicular recrudescence, after which we measured baseline testosterone, testosterone after an acute handling stressor, and capacity to produce testosterone after hormonal stimulation. In a 2×2 design, we then killed males from the two chronic treatment groups either immediately or after an acute stressor to investigate the effect of long- and short-term stressors on the testicular transcriptome. We found that chronically disturbed birds had marginally lower baseline testosterone. The acute stressor suppressed testosterone in control birds, but not in the chronic disturbance group. The ability to elevate testosterone did not differ between the chronic treatments. Surprisingly, chronic disturbance had a weak effect on the testicular transcriptome, and did not affect the transcriptomic response to the acute stressor. The acute stressor, on the other hand, upregulated the cellular stress response and affected expression of genes associated with hormonal stress response. Overall, we show that testicular function is sensitive to acute stressors but surprisingly robust to long-term stressors, and that chronic disturbance attenuates the decrease in testosterone in response to an acute stressor.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Abolins-Abols","given":"Mikus"},{"family":"Hanauer","given":"Rachel E."},{"family":"Rosvall","given":"Kimberly A."},{"family":"Peterson","given":"Mark P."},{"family":"Ketterson","given":"Ellen D."}],"citation-key":"abolins-abols2018jeb","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Biology","DOI":"10.1242/jeb.180869","ISSN":"0022-0949, 1477-9145","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,1]]},"language":"en","PMID":"29997161","publisher":"The Company of Biologists Ltd","section":"Research Article","source":"jeb.biologists.org","title":"The effect of chronic and acute stressors, and their interaction, on testes function: an experimental test during testicular recrudescence","title-short":"The effect of chronic and acute stressors, and their interaction, on testes function","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://jeb.biologists.org/content/221/17/jeb180869","volume":"221"},
  {"id":"abolins-abols2018me","abstract":"Colour plays a prominent role in species recognition; therefore, understanding the proximate basis of pigmentation can provide insight into reproductive isolation and speciation. Colour differences between taxa may be the result of regulatory differences or be caused by mutations in coding regions of the expressed genes. To investigate these two alternatives, we studied the pigment composition and the genetic basis of coloration in two divergent dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis) subspecies, the slate-coloured and Oregon juncos, which have evolved marked differences in plumage coloration since the Last Glacial Maximum. We used HPLC and light microscopy to investigate pigment composition and deposition in feathers from four body areas. We then used RNA-seq to compare the relative roles of differential gene expression in developing feathers and sequence divergence in transcribed loci under common-garden conditions. Junco feathers differed in eumelanin and pheomelanin content and distribution. Within subspecies, in lighter feathers melanin synthesis genes were downregulated (including PMEL, TYR, TYRP1, OCA2 and MLANA), and ASIP was upregulated. Feathers from different body regions also showed differential expression of HOX and WNT genes. Feathers from the same body regions that differed in colour between the two subspecies showed differential expression of ASIP and three other genes (MFSD12, KCNJ13 and HAND2) associated with pigmentation in other taxa. Sequence variation in the expressed genes was not related to colour differences. Our findings support the hypothesis that differential regulation of a few genes can account for marked differences in coloration, a mechanism that may facilitate the rapid phenotypic diversification of juncos.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Abolins‐Abols","given":"Mikus"},{"family":"Kornobis","given":"Etienne"},{"family":"Ribeca","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Wakamatsu","given":"Kazumasa"},{"family":"Peterson","given":"Mark P."},{"family":"Ketterson","given":"Ellen D."},{"family":"Milá","given":"Borja"}],"citation-key":"abolins-abols2018me","container-title":"Molecular Ecology","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.14878","ISSN":"1365-294X","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mec.14878","page":"4501-4515","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Differential gene regulation underlies variation in melanic plumage coloration in the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.14878","volume":"27"},

Herein we evaluate species-specific use curves based upon capture times during the overlapping activity of bat species at two water holes in an arid environment where bats likely suffer high levels of evaporative water loss during roosting. During the first 75 min after sunset, intense bat activity at each water hole ensued and, although visitation times overlapped, there was a significant difference among species use curves. In addition, pairwise comparisons showed high similarity in temporal visitation patterns across sites for species in which capture numbers were comparable, whereas other species shifted to significantly earlier arrival times when their capture numbers were higher. There were no significant differences in mean roost site emergence times among species, nor in distance of roost sites from water holes. Our data provide one of the few statistically verified examples of fine-grain temporal partitioning by mammals simultaneously using the same resource.

For seamless navigation, the sensors’ signal quality and the sensors availability are major challenges. Heading estimation is a fundamental challenge in the GPS-denied environments; therefore, targeting accurate attitude estimation is considered significant contribution to the overall navigation error. For that end, this research targets an improved pedestrian navigation by developing sensors fusion technique to exploit the gyroscope, magnetometer, and accelerometer data for device attitude estimation in the different environments based on quaternion mechanization.

But in recent geolocator studies, despite now being able to track individual songbirds during their entire migration, their stopover behaviour has received little attention. We used light-sensitive geolocators to identify the migratory routes and schedules of 12 northern wheatears (Oenanthe oenanthe) breeding in Sweden. Three geolocators collected temperature data complementing inferences from light data by providing additional information on behaviour during migration. The wheatears performed a slow migration with considerable stopover time (84%/76% of autumn/spring migration), with short stops while traveling through Europe, and a prolonged stopover period in both autumn and spring in the Mediterranean region. Spring migration was faster than autumn migration, mainly because of decreased stopover time. Migration routes and time schedules were similar to those from a German breeding population. Compared to wheatears breeding in Alaska with a three-fold migration distance, Swedish wheatears spent more time during stopovers during autumn and spring migration, suggesting less time constraints and potential flexibility in migration schedules. The finding of prolonged stopovers, similar to other recent geolocator studies, shows that temporary residency periods may be common. This changes our current view on stopover ecology to one where temporary residency periods are part of spatio-temporal strategies optimising resource use during the entire annual cycle.","author":[{"family":"Arlt","given":"Debora"},{"family":"Olsson","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Fox","given":"James W"},{"family":"Low","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Pärt","given":"Tomas"}],"citation-key":"arlt2015am","container-title":"Animal Migration","DOI":"10.1515/ami-2015-0002","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,4]]},"page":"47-62","publisher":"Walter de Gruyter GmbH","title":"Prolonged stopover duration characterises migration strategy and constraints of a long-distance migrant songbird","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1515/ami-2015-0002","volume":"2"},

Such data show that birds using much energysaving soaring/gliding flight like frigatebirds and swifts can stay airborne without landing for several months. Successful accelerometer studies have recently been conducted also for free-flying small songbirds during their entire annual cycle. Here we review the principles and possibilities for accelerometer studies in bird migration. We use the first annual actograms (for red-backed shrike Lanius collurio) to explore new analyses and insights that become possible with accelerometer data. Actogram data allow precise estimates of numbers of flights, flight durations as well as departure/landing times during the annual cycle. Annual and diurnal rhythms of migratory flights, as well as prolonged nocturnal flights across desert barriers are illustrated. The shifting balance between flight, rest and different intensities of activity throughout the year as revealed by actogram data can be used to analyse exertion levels during different phases of the life cycle.

We tracked individuals breeding in the Swiss Alps using geolocators, multi-sensor loggers and GPS. Of the birds traced to their non-breeding quarters, two thirds reached the Atlas Mountains while one third stayed in Spain, a region potentially more significant for overwintering than previously thought. The birds remained mostly above 1000 m throughout the annual cycle, highlighting a strict association of ring ouzels with mountain habitats. We also evidenced daily transhumance, especially upon spring arrival on the breeding grounds, which provides some noticeable behavioural flexibility, i.e. adaptative potential in response to environmental variation.

  {"id":"basson2016mee","abstract":"Summary Electronic tags have revolutionised animal movement studies, but the reliability of subsequent ecological inference hinges on being able to quantify uncertainty in location estimates. Light-based geolocation, which uses the time series of light intensity during twilight events, remains the only viable technology for many species (e.g. fish and small birds) despite its limited accuracy. Modern approaches to movement modelling, such as Kalman filters and gridded hidden Markov models, require a valid likelihood for each observed twilight. It is difficult to directly construct such a likelihood (i.e. the probability density of the light data during a twilight period) given any location on the globe, because of complicated autocorrelation structures and non-standard statistical distributions. We therefore use data from moored tags at known locations to construct a transformation that turns a simple one-dimensional statistic into a quantity with the properties of a log-likelihood. The result is a set of calibration splines that can be used with light data from a similar tag deployed on a real animal: for each twilight, the one-dimensional statistic is calculated for any location (e.g. on a grid of, or all possible, locations) and then transformed into a likelihood using the calibration splines. The likelihoods can then be input to any state-space model to estimate a track. We show an example track from a grid-based hidden Markov model applied to light data from a tag deployed on a southern bluefin tuna. This approach to light-based geolocation provides the flexibility to integrate movement and behaviour modelling in a novel way. The likelihood surfaces from our approach can be used in any state-space model of animal movement and behaviour, irrespective of whether estimation is by maximum-likelihood or Bayesian methods. Our approach is primarily aimed at users interested in developing and fitting their own state-space models to explore biological hypotheses about animal behaviour.","author":[{"family":"Basson","given":"Marinelle"},{"family":"Bravington","given":"Mark V"},{"family":"Hartog","given":"Jason R"},{"family":"Patterson","given":"Toby A"}],"citation-key":"basson2016mee","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.12555","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,8]]},"page":"980-989","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","title":"Experimentally derived likelihoods for light-based geolocation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12555","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"bauer2016ta","abstract":"For birds, a migratory lifestyle confers several benefits including avoidance of harsh winters and increased access to food resources during the breeding season. However, migration is energetically costly and elevates oxidative stress, which may contribute to increased mortality during migration. Oxidative stress is known to shorten telomeres, which are protective DNA regions on the ends of chromosomes. Thus, one consequence of migration may be accelerated telomere attrition. A migratory lifestyle may also increase telomere shortening via reduced investment into self-maintenance, as high mortality during migration may cause migrants to invest more in reproduction than residents. We therefore hypothesized that greater telomere attrition may reflect a long-term cost of a migratory life history strategy. We predicted that, among individuals of the same age, migrants would have shorter telomeres as compared to residents. We compared first-year individuals in an overwintering population of Slate-colored Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis) that included both a migratory (J. h. hyemalis) and resident (J. h. carolinensis) subspecies in western Virginia. As predicted, first-year migrants had shorter telomeres than first-year residents. Since members of both subspecies experienced the same winter conditions and had not yet bred, differences in telomere lengths are likely due to migration-related costs as this was the only energetically expensive life history stage that differed between subspecies. Telomere length differences between subspecies could also be due to differences in initial telomere lengths or loss during growth, which could reflect relative investment into self-maintenance. These results are consistent with the idea that accelerated telomere shortening is a potential cost of a migratory life history strategy. This consequence could be the result of direct metabolic costs of migration and/or a life history strategy that places less emphasis on self-maintenance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Bauer","given":"Carolyn M."},{"family":"Heidinger","given":"Britt J."},{"family":"Ketterson","given":"Ellen D."},{"family":"Greives","given":"Timothy J."}],"citation-key":"bauer2016ta","container-title":"The Auk","container-title-short":"The Auk","DOI":"10.1642/AUK-16-56.1","ISSN":"1938-4254","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,1]]},"page":"649-653","source":"Silverchair","title":"A migratory lifestyle is associated with shorter telomeres in a songbird (Junco hyemalis)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1642/AUK-16-56.1","volume":"133"},
  {"id":"bauer2018potrsbbs","abstract":"Allochrony, the mismatch of reproductive schedules, is one mechanism that can mediate sympatric speciation and diversification. In songbirds, the transition into breeding condition and gonadal growth is regulated by the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis at multiple levels. We investigated whether the difference in reproductive timing between two seasonally sympatric subspecies of dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) was related to gene expression along the HPG axis. During the sympatric pre-breeding stage, we measured hypothalamic and testicular mRNA expression of candidate genes via qPCR in captive male juncos. For hypothalamic mRNA, we found our earlier breeding subspecies had increased expression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and decreased expression of androgen receptor, oestrogen receptor alpha and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Subspecies did not differ in expression of hypothalamic gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR). While our earlier breeding subspecies had higher mRNA expression of testicular GR, subspecies did not differ in testicular luteinizing hormone receptor, follicle-stimulating hormone receptor or MR mRNA expression levels. Our findings indicate increased GnRH production and decreased hypothalamic sensitivity to sex steroid negative feedback as factors promoting differences in the timing of gonadal recrudescence between recently diverged populations.

In the deployment year, we compared adult provisioning rates to nestlings, nestling growth and nest success between nesting attempts in which adult males were fitted with a geolocator, with control nests where males had the same capture history but were not tagged. We found no difference between treatments in provisioning effort by males or their associated female 2 days after geolocator fitting, in terms of nestling growth, subsequent brood reduction or nest success. Return rate, arrival date on territories, nest timing and breeding parameters were compared between tagged and untagged males in the following breeding season. We found no difference in return rate or arrival date, and no difference in nest timing, fecundity or outcome. Our study suggests that fitting lightweight tags to small passerines need not affect behaviour, breeding or apparent between-year survival.

  {"id":"benitez-paez2021me","abstract":"Background: Migratory animals use information from the Earth’s magnetic field on their journeys. Geomagnetic navigation has been observed across many taxa, but how animals use geomagnetic information to find their way is still relatively unknown. Most migration studies use a static representation of geomagnetic field and do not consider its temporal variation. However, short-term temporal perturbations may affect how animals respond - to understand this phenomenon, we need to obtain fine resolution accurate geomagnetic measurements at the location and time of the animal. Satellite geomagnetic measurements provide a potential to create such accurate measurements, yet have not been used yet for exploration of animal migration.\nMethods: We develop a new tool for data fusion of satellite geomagnetic data (from the European Space Agency’s Swarm constellation) with animal tracking data using a spatio-temporal interpolation approach. We assess accuracy of the fusion through a comparison with calibrated terrestrial measurements from the International Real-time Magnetic Observatory Network (INTERMAGNET). We fit a generalized linear model (GLM) to assess how the absolute error of annotated geomagnetic intensity varies with interpolation parameters and with the local geomagnetic disturbance.\nResults: We find that the average absolute error of intensity is − 21.6 nT (95% CI [− 22.26555, − 20.96664]), which is at the lower range of the intensity that animals can sense. The main predictor of error is the level of geomagnetic disturbance, given by the Kp index (indicating the presence of a geomagnetic storm). Since storm level disturbances are rare, this means that our tool is suitable for studies of animal geomagnetic navigation. Caution should be taken with data obtained during geomagnetically disturbed days due to rapid and localised changes of the field which may not be adequately captured.\nConclusions: By using our new tool, ecologists will be able to, for the first time, access accurate real-time satellite geomagnetic data at the location and time of each tracked animal, without having to start new tracking studies with specialised magnetic sensors.

  {"id":"bindoff2018mee","abstract":"Abstract Solar geolocation is used to quantify the movements of animals tagged with sensors that record ambient light with respect to time. Global location sensor (GLS) tags are small, light, and present minimal drag or wing loading. They are affordable, and some can record data for several migratory cycles. These benefits mean they can be used in applications for which satellite tags are unsuitable. However, large errors in estimated locations can result if the sensor is obscured, especially around twilight, and sometimes the data obtained is unusable by existing methods of analysis due to this source of noise. This places limitations on the usefulness of solar geolocation in conservation and monitoring efforts. All existing methods of analysis are dependent on twilights being identifiable or faithfully recorded. Instead, the method introduced here depends on the overall pattern of day and night to calculate the likelihoods for a Hidden Markov Model, where the hidden states are geographic locations. We call this a ?twilight-free? method of light-based geolocation. This method quickly estimates locations from otherwise unusable noisy light data. We use examples to show that the method produces tracks that are comparable in accuracy and precision to other geolocation methods. Furthermore, efficiency and replicability of estimated paths are improved because the user does not have to subjectively identify twilights. Other data sources, such as sea surface temperature and land or sea masks are easily incorporated, further improving location estimates and processing speed. The twilight-free method offers new opportunities to researchers interested in the movements of animals that routinely have obscured sensors, or to analyse previously unusable noisy light data. It offers a fast, efficient, and replicable method for analysing tag data without the need for time-consuming pre- or post-processing. By increasing the yield of usable data from GLS tagging studies, researchers can more efficiently quantify where animals are going and when, and monitor changes in habitat. This is of fundamental importance to management and conservation efforts.","author":[{"family":"Bindoff","given":"Aidan D"},{"family":"Wotherspoon","given":"Simon J"},{"family":"Guinet","given":"Christophe"},{"family":"Hindell","given":"Mark A"}],"citation-key":"bindoff2018mee","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.12953","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,5]]},"page":"1190-1198","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","title":"Twilight-free geolocation from noisy light data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12953","volume":"9"},

In this study we investigated the possibilities for geomagnetic bi-coordinate map navigation in different regions of the earth by analysing angular differences between isolines of geomagnetic total intensity and inclination. In ?no-grid? zones where isolines were running almost parallel, efficient geomagnetic bi-coordinate navigation would probably not be feasible. These zones formed four distinct areas with a north-south extension in the northern hemisphere, whereas the pattern in the southern hemisphere was more diffuse. On each side of these zones there was often a mirror effect where identical combinations of the geomagnetic parameters appeared. This may potentially cause problems for species migrating long distances east-west across longitudes, since they may pass areas with identical geomagnetic coordinates. Migration routes assumed for four populations of migratory passerine birds were used to illustrate the possibilities of geomagnetic bi-coordinate map navigation along different routes. We conclude that it is unlikely that animal navigation is universally based on a geomagnetic bi-coordinate map mechanism only, and we predict that the relative importance of geomagnetic coordinate information differs between animals, areas and routes, depending on the different conditions for bi-coordinate geomagnetic navigation in different regions of the earth.","author":[{"family":"Boström","given":"Jannika E"},{"family":"Åkesson","given":"Susanne"},{"family":"Alerstam","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"bostrom2012e","container-title":"Ecography","DOI":"10.1111/j.1600-0587.2012.07507.x","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,11]]},"page":"1039-1047","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","title":"Where on earth can animals use a geomagnetic bi-coordinate map for navigation?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2012.07507.x","volume":"35"},

  {"id":"bridge2013","abstract":"For centuries, naturalists have wondered how small migratory birds move between breeding sites and wintering locations, but our ability to study songbird migration has been limited by the logistical challenge of tracking tiny birds that fly thousands of kilometers. In just the past few years, researchers have been experimenting with a new tracking device that can revolutionize our understanding of migration by determining the migration routes of individual song birds. This key innovation is called an electronic tracking device called a geolocation datalogger (or geologger), which has recently been miniaturized to a mass of 0.5 grams—small enough to deploy on birds weighing around 10 grams. Geologgers work by logging light levels at regular intervals such that one can determine the duration of the daylight period (day length) and the midpoint between sunrise and sunset (solar noon). With these two bits of information from each day the bird wears the tag, we can estimate latitude from day length and longitude from the time of solar noon. Although this method is simple and intuitive, it does not allow for error estimation. Moreover, current analysis practices generally have low repeatability and are very sensitive to perturbations in the light-level data caused by shading particularly during twilight events (caused by environmental factors or bird behavior). More sophisticated analysis tools are available, but they are underused because they require special skills (i.e. familiarity with the R computing environment) and lack extensive documentation. The goals of the Animal-Tracking Analysis Working Group are: 1) Increase accessibility of analysis tools by creating a user-friendly web interface that can perform simple on-line analysis of light level data and format the data for use in more sophisticated tools 2) Promote transparency and data-sharing among those using light-level geolocation data loggers via the web interface, through use of analytical methods in the public domain, and through use of the Movebank archive and other data repositories 3) Update and compare existing analytical tools and publish guidelines for their use. Membership of the working group consists of programmers who have written movement analysis software, field biologists with real-world data to analyze, and administrators and data curators of ecological data archives. Our meetings will not only result in the best possible analysis software but will promote individual research projects and multi-project collaborations among the working group members. Example of a migration track from a geologger mounted on a Painted Bunting. The blue crosses show locations generated from simple calculations based on day length and the time of solar noon. The red and yellow colors show the likely ranges for residency and movement based on an animal movement model within an analysis package called TripEstimation. The movement model generates a narrower migration path because it assumes there are limits to the extent that a bird can fly in a single day. Movement models can also account for land cover and habitat types to further improve estimations of migration paths. UPDATE: October 2013 Publications and Other Products Progress on Goal 1: We have established TAGS (the Totally Awesome Geolocator Service), which is a simple web interface that allows users to upload raw light level data, quickly edit the data where necessary, and get a first look at location estimates for the tracked animal. TAGS can output both coordinate data and a data format that will work with the more sophisticated analysis tools. TAGS output includes a complete record of edits made to the original data set. Thus, researchers can make this output available to ensure that analysis by other researchers can replicate the original results. Progress on Goal 2: TAGS output is also formatted for upload into the Movebank archive, which will promote data sharing among scientists and the general public. We are currently working toward a tighter interface between TAGS and Movebank that will allow a more direct flow of data between the two services. Progress on Goal 3: Our group seeks to improve methods for analyzing light-level geolocation data by incorporating animal movement models into a bayesian framework that generates location estimates. We have brought together biologists who use light-level data loggers as well as programmers and statisticians who have generated different analytical approaches to the analysis of light-level data. The meetings have spurred several new directions with regard to analysis techniques, and two new analysis packages for the R programming language are nearing finalization. To help promote the use of these new analysis techniques we are drafting a manuscript that will analyze simulated light-level data from a theoretical tag assigned to a specific (known) movement path that represent the migration of a songbird. Our analyzes will help determine how well different analysis methods capture various features of the underlying movement path and will help readers decide what analysis method best suits their needs. The working title of the manuscript is \"New tools for the analysis of light-level geolocation data to derive migration tracks: guidelines and comparisons based on real and simulated data\".","author":[{"family":"Bridge","given":"Eli"},{"family":"Winkler","given":"David"},{"family":"Rakhimberdiev","given":"Eldar"},{"family":"Seavy","given":"Nathaniel"}],"citation-key":"bridge2013","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"title":"Animal-Tracking Analysis for Geolocators","type":"personal_communication","URL":"https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/featured/bridge"},

  {"id":"briedis2020jab","abstract":"Migratory birds complete their seasonal journeys between breeding and non-breeding sites with a series of migratory flights that are separated by prolonged stopovers. While songbirds are the most common taxa among migratory birds, empirical data on flight and stopover behaviour along their entire migratory journeys are still rare. Here, we integrate activity and barometric pressure tracking with classical light-level geolocation to describe migration behaviour of tawny pipits Anthus campestris breeding in central Europe. Surprisingly, tracked pipits used, on average, as many as 10 stopover sites during their six week, > 5000 km long autumn migration. This conforms to a typical hop-type pattern of migration. In contrast to common knowledge which considers the tawny pipit as a typical diurnal migrant, our data revealed that more than two thirds of all migratory movements were carried out at night. Nocturnal departure times were highly variable within individuals and spread across the entire night while landing most often took place within the first few hours after sunrise. Consequently, there was a negative relationship between departure timing relative to sunset and flight duration. Short flights of up to 2 h were most common and median flight duration was 4.5 h. There was a hyperbolic relationship between flight duration and maximum flight altitude and flight altitudes during night were two times higher compared to daytime. The overall ratio of flight versus stopover duration during migration was on average 1:6.5. This closely matches predictions from theoretical models. We show that multi-sensor tracking has the potential to provide unprecedented details on migratory behaviour of individual birds along their entire migratory journeys, and it also improves the precision of geographical locations derived from light-level geolocators.","author":[{"family":"Briedis","given":"Martins"},{"family":"Beran","given":"Václav"},{"family":"Adamík","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Hahn","given":"Steffen"}],"citation-key":"briedis2020jab","container-title":"Journal of Avian Biology","DOI":"10.1111/jav.02546","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9]]},"publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","title":"Integrating light-level geolocation with activity tracking reveals unexpected nocturnal migration patterns of the tawny pipit","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jav.02546","volume":"51"},
  {"id":"brlik2020jae","abstract":"Currently, the deployment of tracking devices is one of the most frequently used approaches to study movement ecology of birds. Recent miniaturization of light-level geolocators enabled studying small bird species whose migratory patterns were widely unknown. However, geolocators may reduce vital rates in tagged birds and may bias obtained movement data. There is a need for a thorough assessment of the potential tag effects on small birds, as previous meta-analyses did not evaluate unpublished data and impact of multiple life-history traits, focused mainly on large species and the number of published studies tagging small birds has increased substantially. We quantitatively reviewed 549 records extracted from 74 published and 48 unpublished studies on over 7,800 tagged and 17,800 control individuals to examine the effects of geolocator tagging on small bird species (body mass <100 g). We calculated the effect of tagging on apparent survival, condition, phenology and breeding performance and identified the most important predictors of the magnitude of effect sizes. Even though the effects were not statistically significant in phylogenetically controlled models, we found a weak negative impact of geolocators on apparent survival. The negative effect on apparent survival was stronger with increasing relative load of the device and with geolocators attached using elastic harnesses. Moreover, tagging effects were stronger in smaller species. In conclusion, we found a weak effect on apparent survival of tagged birds and managed to pinpoint key aspects and drivers of tagging effects. We provide recommendations for establishing matched control group for proper effect size assessment in future studies and outline various aspects of tagging that need further investigation. Finally, our results encourage further use of geolocators on small bird species but the ethical aspects and scientific benefits should always be considered.","author":[{"family":"Brlík","given":"Vojtěch"},{"family":"Koleček","given":"Jaroslav"},{"family":"Burgess","given":"Malcolm"},{"family":"Hahn","given":"Steffen"},{"family":"Humple","given":"Diana"},{"family":"Krist","given":"Miloš"},{"family":"Ouwehand","given":"Janne"},{"family":"Weiser","given":"Emily L"},{"family":"Adamík","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Alves","given":"José A"},{"family":"Arlt","given":"Debora"},{"family":"Barišić","given":"Sanja"},{"family":"Becker","given":"Detlef"},{"family":"Belda","given":"Eduardo J"},{"family":"Beran","given":"Václav"},{"family":"Both","given":"Christiaan"},{"family":"Bravo","given":"Susana P"},{"family":"Briedis","given":"Martins"},{"family":"Chutný","given":"Bohumír"},{"family":"Ćiković","given":"Davor"},{"family":"Cooper","given":"Nathan W"},{"family":"Costa","given":"Joana S"},{"family":"Cueto","given":"Víctor R"},{"family":"Emmenegger","given":"Tamara"},{"family":"Fraser","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Gilg","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Guerrero","given":"Marina"},{"family":"Hallworth","given":"Michael T"},{"family":"Hewson","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Jiguet","given":"Frédéric"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"James A"},{"family":"Kelly","given":"Tosha"},{"family":"Kishkinev","given":"Dmitry"},{"family":"Leconte","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Lislevand","given":"Terje"},{"family":"Lisovski","given":"Simeon"},{"family":"López","given":"Cosme"},{"family":"McFarland","given":"Kent P"},{"family":"Marra","given":"Peter P"},{"family":"Matsuoka","given":"Steven M"},{"family":"Matyjasiak","given":"Piotr"},{"family":"Meier","given":"Christoph M"},{"family":"Metzger","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Monrós","given":"Juan S"},{"family":"Neumann","given":"Roland"},{"family":"Newman","given":"Amy"},{"family":"Norris","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Pärt","given":"Tomas"},{"family":"Pavel","given":"Václav"},{"family":"Perlut","given":"Noah"},{"family":"Piha","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Reneerkens","given":"Jeroen"},{"family":"Rimmer","given":"Christopher C"},{"family":"Roberto-Charron","given":"Amélie"},{"family":"Scandolara","given":"Chiara"},{"family":"Sokolova","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Takenaka","given":"Makiko"},{"family":"Tolkmitt","given":"Dirk"},{"family":"Oosten","given":"Herman","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Wellbrock","given":"Arndt H.J."},{"family":"Wheeler","given":"Hazel"},{"family":"Winden","given":"Jan","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Witte","given":"Klaudia"},{"family":"Woodworth","given":"Bradley K"},{"family":"Procházka","given":"Petr"}],"citation-key":"brlik2020jae","container-title":"Journal of Animal Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2656.12962","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"page":"207-220","title":"Weak effects of geolocators on small birds: A meta-analysis controlled for phylogeny and publication bias","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2656.12962","volume":"89"},

  {"id":"brown2005pam-in","abstract":"The NAVSYS TrackTag® uses NAVSYS proprietary technology to dramatically reduce on-time for GPS data acquisition. This has a major effect on battery size and lifetime, permitting extremely small package archival GPS tags to be built for applications such as bird and animal tracking. The TrackTag captures raw, unprocessed GPS data in a less than 30 millisecond snapshot for download when the tag is retrieved. Typically data for 64,000 positions can be recorded. The tag provides over 2 years operation with frequent updates. The packaged weight is less than 30 grams. Great flexibility, relative to update rates, is available. The time of data measurement and temperature is recorded. Other data inputs such pressure, humidity, CO2, etc. can also be recorded from auxiliary sensors. This paper describes the TrackTag, its attributes, and presents data from recent applications. In particular, the performance of the TrackTag is illustrated with plots of an albatross's journey of 8300 miles in three weeks in the Antarctic. Positioning under heavy canopy in the Amazon is also shown. Future applications for the US Military, Homeland Defense, etc. are covered with further TrackTag improvements under development.","author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"Alison K."},{"family":"Brown","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"brown2005pam-in","container-title":"Proceedings of the Annual Meeting - Institute of Navigation","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005]]},"page":"726-732","title":"Ultra low-power GPS recorder (TrackTag®)","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"brown2013ab","abstract":"Behavior is an important mechanism of evolution and it is paid for through energy expenditure. Nevertheless, field biologists can rarely observe animals for more than a fraction of their daily activities and attempts to quantify behavior for modeling ecological processes often exclude cryptic yet important behavioral events. Over the past few years, an explosion of research on remote monitoring of animal behavior using acceleration sensors has smashed the decades-old limits of observational studies. Animal-attached accelerometers measure the change in velocity of the body over time and can quantify fine-scale movements and body postures unlimited by visibility, observer bias, or the scale of space use. Pioneered more than a decade ago, application of accelerometers as a remote monitoring tool has recently surged thanks to the development of more accessible hardware and software. It has been applied to more than 120 species of animals to date. Accelerometer measurements are typically collected in three dimensions of movement at very high resolution (>10Hz), and have so far been applied towards two main objectives. First, the patterns of accelerometer waveforms can be used to deduce specific behaviors through animal movement and body posture. Second, the variation in accelerometer waveform measurements has been shown to correlate with energy expenditure, opening up a suite of scientific questions in species notoriously difficult to observe in the wild. To date, studies of wild aquatic species outnumber wild terrestrial species and analyses of social behaviors are particularly few in number. Researchers of domestic and captive species also tend to report methodology more thoroughly than those studying species in the wild. There are substantial challenges to getting the most out of accelerometers, including validation, calibration, and the management and analysis of large quantities of data. In this review, we illustrate how accelerometers work, provide an overview of the ecological questions that have employed accelerometry, and highlight the emerging best practices for data acquisition and analysis. This tool offers a level of detail in behavioral studies of free-ranging wild animals that has previously been impossible to achieve and, across scientific disciplines, it improves understanding of the role of behavioral mechanisms in ecological and evolutionary processes.","author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"Danielle D."},{"family":"Kays","given":"Roland"},{"family":"Wikelski","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Rory"},{"family":"Klimley","given":"A.

  {"id":"brownjohnUniversalResponseSpectrum2016","abstract":"Floor vibrations caused by people walking are an important serviceability problem both for human occupants and vibration-sensitive equipment. Present design methodologies available for prediction of vibration response due to footfall loading are complex and suffer from division between low and high frequency floors. In order to simplify the design process and to avoid the problem of floor classification, this paper presents a methodology for predicting vibration response metrics due to pedestrian footfalls for any floor type having natural frequency in the range 1–20Hz. Using a response spectrum approach, a database of 852 weight-normalised vertical ground reaction force (GRF) time histories recorded for more than 60 individuals walking on an instrumented treadmill was used to calculate response metrics. Chosen metrics were peak values of 1s peak root-mean-square (RMS) acceleration and peak envelope one-third octave velocities. These were evaluated by weight-normalising the GRFs and applying to unit-mass single degree of freedom oscillators having natural frequencies in the range 1–20Hz and damping ratios in the range 0.5–5%. Moreover, to account for effect of mode shape and duration of crossing (i.e. duration of dynamic loading), the recorded GRFs were applied for three most typical mode shapes and floor spans from 5m to 40m. The resulting peak values as functions of frequency i.e. spectra are condensed to statistical representations for chosen probability of being exceeded over a wide range of applications. RMS (acceleration) spectra show strong peaks corresponding to the first harmonic of pacing rate followed by clear minima at approximately 3.5Hz, a second much smaller peak corresponding to the second harmonic and a steady decline with increasing frequency beginning around 5Hz. One-third octave spectra show asymptotic trends with frequency, span and damping. A comprehensive validation exercise focusing on the acceleration RMS spectra was based on a representative range of floor samples for which modal properties had been identified and walking response studied during experimental campaigns of vibration serviceability evaluation. Due to the statistical approach an exact validation would not be possible, hence measured peak RMS values were matched to distributions for the equivalent idealised structure. In the vast majority of cases the measured values, intended to represent worst-case conditions, fitted the upper decile of the corresponding simulated spectra indicating consistency with the proposed approach.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Brownjohn","given":"James"},{"family":"Racic","given":"Vitomir"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Jun"}],"citation-key":"brownjohnUniversalResponseSpectrum2016","container-title":"Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing","container-title-short":"Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing","DOI":"10.1016/j.ymssp.2015.09.010","ISSN":"0888-3270","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"741-755","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Universal response spectrum procedure for predicting walking-induced floor vibration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888327015004057","volume":"70-71"},

Our tool relies on the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) to obtain irradiance and weather data patterns for the site. Irradiance is mapped onto a PV model estimate of a solar plant's 30-min power output, based on the configuration of the panel. The working hypothesis to generate high-resolution (e.g. 1 second) solar data is that the conditional distribution of the time series of solar power output given the cloud density is the same for different locations. We therefore propose a stochastic model with a switching behavior due to different weather regimes as provided by the cloud type label in the NSRDB, and train our stochastic model parameters for the cloudy states on the high-resolution solar power measurements from a Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU). In the paper we introduce the stochastic model, and the methodology used for the training of its parameters. The numerical results show that our tool creates synthetic solar time series at high resolutions that are statistically representative of the measured solar power and illustrate how to make use of the tool to create synthetic data for arbitrary sites in the footprint covered by the NSRDB.","author":[{"family":"Carreño","given":"I L"},{"family":"Ramakrishna","given":"R"},{"family":"Scaglione","given":"A"},{"family":"Arnold","given":"D"},{"family":"Roberts","given":"C"},{"family":"Ngo","given":"S -T."},{"family":"Peisert","given":"S"},{"family":"Pinney","given":"D"}],"citation-key":"carreno20202iicccctsgs","container-title":"2020 IEEE International Conference on Communications, Control, and Computing Technologies for Smart Grids (SmartGridComm)","DOI":"10.1109/SmartGridComm47815.2020.9302941","ISBN":"VO -","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"page":"1-6","title":"SoDa: An Irradiance-Based Synthetic Solar Data Generation Tool","type":"paper-conference"},

As BLE technology is designed for device-to-device communication, the bleRPC framework provides a means for a service in a bleRPC supported set-top box to distinguish between remote applications in the same user smartphone. Consequently, this study also contributes to providing application-level authentication and access control mechanisms for BLE-based service. This study implements the bleRPC framework on the Android TV platform, which is one of the state-of-the-art set-top box platforms.

As migratory species and populations vary in the degree to which individuals from distinct breeding locales mix on stop-over sites and wintering grounds, establishing migratory connectivity informs our understanding of population demography and species management. We present a new Bayesian approach for inferring breeding grounds of wintering birds of unknown origins in North America. We incorporate prior information from analysis of genetic markers into geographic origin assignment based upon stable-hydrogen isotope analysis of feathers (δ2Hf), using the Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius ludovicianus). Likely geographic origins derived from analyses of DNA microsatellites were used as priors for Bayesian analyses in which birds were assigned to a breeding-ground origin using their δ2Hf values. As with most applications of Bayesian methods, our approach greatly improved the results (i.e. decreased the size of the potential area of origin). Area of origin decreased by 3 to 5-fold on average, but ranged up to a 10-fold improvement. We recommend this approach in future studies of migratory connectivity and suggest that our methodology could be applied more broadly to the study of dispersal, sources of productivity of migratory populations, and a range of evolutionary phenomena. © 2012 Chabot et al.","author":[{"family":"Chabot","given":"Amy A"},{"family":"Hobson","given":"Keith A"},{"family":"Wilgenburg","given":"Steven L.","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"McQuat","given":"Gregory J."},{"family":"Lougheed","given":"Stephen C"}],"citation-key":"chabot2012po","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0043627","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"page":"e43627-e43627","title":"Advances in linking wintering migrant birds to their breeding-ground origins using combined analyses of genetic and stable isotope markers","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"chamberlain1996o","abstract":"To determine whether stable isotopes can be used for identifying the geographic origins of migratory bird populations, we examined the isotopic composition of hydrogen (deuterium, δD), carbon (δ13C), and strontium (δ87Sr) in tissues of a migratory passerine, the black-throated blue warbler (Dendroica caerulescens), throughout its breeding range in eastern North America. δD and δ13C values in feathers, which are grown in the breeding area, varied systematically along a latitudinal gradient, being highest in samples from the southern end of the species’ breeding range in Georgia and lowest in southern Canada. In addition, δD decreased from east to west across the northern part of the breeding range, from New Brunswick to Michigan. δ87Sr ratios were highest in the Appalachian Mountains, and decreased towards the west. These patterns are consistent with geographical variation in the isotopic composition of the natural environment, i.e., with that of precipitation, plants, and soils for δD, δ13C, and δ87Sr, respectively. Preliminary analyses of the δD and δ13C composition of feathers collected from warblers in their Caribbean winter grounds indicate that these individuals were mostly from northern breeding populations. Furthermore, variances in isotope ratios in samples from local areas in winter tended to be larger than those in summer, suggesting that individuals from different breeding localities may mix in winter habitats. These isotope markers, therefore, have the potential for locating the breeding origins of migratory species on their winter areas, for quantifying the degree of mixing of breeding populations on migratory and wintering sites, and for documenting other aspects of the population structure migratory animals – information needed for studies of year-round ecology of these species as well as for their conservation. Combining information from several stable isotopes will help to increase the resolution for determining the geographic origins of individuals in such highly vagile populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Chamberlain","given":"C.

In order to counteract flow-induced drift from their preferred course, migrants must detect the mean flow direction, and integrate this information with output from their internal compass, to compensate for the deflection. Animals can potentially sense flow direction by two nonexclusive mechanisms: either indirectly, by visually assessing the effect of the current on their movement direction relative to the ground; or directly, via intrinsic properties of the current [4]. Here, we report the first evidence that nocturnal compass-guided insect migrants use a turbulence-mediated mechanism for directly assessing the wind direction hundreds of metres above the ground. By comparison, we find that nocturnally-migrating songbirds do not use turbulence to detect the flow; instead they rely on visual assessment of wind-induced drift to indirectly infer the flow direction.","author":[{"family":"Chapman","given":"Jason W."},{"family":"Nilsson","given":"Cecilia"},{"family":"Lim","given":"Ka S."},{"family":"Bäckman","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Reynolds","given":"Don R."},{"family":"Alerstam","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Reynolds","given":"Andy M."}],"citation-key":"chapman2015cb","container-title":"Current Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.cub.2015.07.074","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,8]]},"page":"R751-R752","publisher":"Cell Press","title":"Detection of flow direction in high-flying insect and songbird migrants","type":"article-journal","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"chernetsov2016bb","abstract":"The question of how migrating birds find their way to winter quarters and back has fascinated humans since the beginning of scientific research into avian biology. Migrating birds have been shown to possess compass systems that allow them to select and maintain certain compass directions. Three such systems are known, solar, stellar and magnetic. Their details are not quite clear and need further research. Hierarchy and interaction of compass systems of migrating birds are poorly studied; different species may vary in this respect. During migration, birds learn to use maps that make true navigation possible, i.e. to detect their position relatively to the goal of movement. The physical nature of navigational maps is an object of intensive research; currently the most promising concepts are the geomagnetic and possibly olfactory maps. A significant contribution to the study of formation of navigational maps was made by Soviet/Russian researchers, whose work was published in Zoologicheskii Zhurnal (Sokolov et al., 1984). Migrating birds have no innate map, and first-autumn individuals reach their species-specific wintering areas by using compass sense and counting time that should be spent moving in certain genetically fixed directions. However, in recent years more and more data surface that suggest that juveniles (maybe not of all species) do have some mechanism of controlling their position on the migratory route that allows them to compensate for errors of the spatio-temporal programme of migration.","author":[{"family":"Chernetsov","given":"N S"}],"citation-key":"chernetsov2016bb","container-title":"Biology Bulletin","DOI":"10.1134/S1062359016080069","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"page":"788-803","title":"Orientation and navigation of migrating birds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1134/S1062359016080069","volume":"43"},

  {"id":"cochranWingbeatFrequencyFlappause2008","abstract":"Powered flapping flight has evolved independently in many different taxa. For flapping fliers, wingbeat parameters such as frequency and amplitude are the primary determinants of these animals’ energetic expenditure during flight. Here we present data on wingbeat frequency and amplitude for three New World thrush species during 15 entire nocturnal migratory flights over the Midwestern United States. Using continuous (non-pulsing) radio transmitters, we were able to measure wingbeat frequency and relative amplitude of wingbeats as well as the characteristics of flap-pauses. Contrary to previous telemetric findings, all of the individuals we followed used both flapping-only and flap-pause flight. During migratory flights, wingbeat frequency, effective wingbeat frequency, and amplitude were highest during initial ascent. Effective wingbeat frequency and amplitude were lowest during final descent. We show that identification of species based solely on characteristics of the wingbeat e.g., during radar studies, can be difficult because variables such as wingbeat frequency and amplitude, wingbeat pausing, and pattern of beats and pauses vary between individuals of the same species and even within individual flights. We also show that observed wingbeat frequencies were lower than those predicted by theoretical models. We speculate that this may be because theoretical predictions are generally based on (1) data from larger birds and (2) data from diurnal flights. We found that diurnal wingbeat frequencies of thrushes were generally higher than were those during nocturnal migratory flight. Finally, we suggest that rather than remaining at a single altitude during flight or climbing slightly as theoretical models predict, thrushes often moved up and down in the air column, perhaps searching for favorable atmospheric conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Cochran","given":"William W."},{"family":"Bowlin","given":"Melissa S."},{"family":"Wikelski","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"cochranWingbeatFrequencyFlappause2008","container-title":"Integrative and Comparative Biology","container-title-short":"Integrative and Comparative Biology","DOI":"10.1093/icb/icn044","ISSN":"1540-7063","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,7,1]]},"page":"134-151","source":"Silverchair","title":"Wingbeat frequency and flap-pause ratio during natural migratory flight in thrushes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/icn044","volume":"48"},

  {"id":"contina2013a","abstract":"Painted Buntings (Passerina ciris) that breed in Oklahoma and molt in Sinaloa, Mexico, demonstrate a clear bimodal pattern of stable isotope ratios in their flight feathers. Some birds had a C3 carbon signature in primary 1 (P1, the first feather replaced during wing molt) and a C4 carbon signature in primary 9 (P9, the last primary to molt), whereas other sympatric birds evinced a C4- based diet throughout feather molt. The bimodal pattern of stable isotope ratios in flight feathers suggests that some birds may initiate molt immediately upon arrival in northwestern Mexico (and carry a C3 signature with them from the breeding grounds) whereas others may delay molt (and grow feathers solely from C4 plants of Sinaloa). From 2010 to 2012, we used geologger tags to test whether differences in the timing and route of fall migration movements were related to stable isotope signatures in primary feathers. We analyzed stable isotopes of hydrogen and carbon in P1 and P9 from 25 individuals fitted with geologger tags in two consecutive years. Of these, 60% changed the diet (C3 vs. C4) that was used to grow P1 between years. We also observed variation among individuals in migration routes, wherein birds from the same breeding population differed greatly in their use of molting and wintering locations. However, we did not find a relationship between isotope signatures and the timing or route of fall migration. We speculate that the bimodal isotope signature we observed represents a carryover effect related to local landscapes (grassland or agriculture vs. shrubland) used during the late breeding season and early molting period, and that these effects diminish as molt progresses. If this is the case, there is the potential for breedingseason diet to directly affect plumage quality in this molt migrant. © 2013 by The American Ornithologists' Union.

  {"id":"cooper2017jab","abstract":"The importance of understanding the geographic distribution of the full annual cycle of migratory birds has been increasingly highlighted over the past several decades. However, the difficulty of tracking small birds between breeding and wintering areas has hindered progress in this area. To learn more about Kirtland's warbler Setophaga kirtlandii movement patterns throughout the annual cycle, we deployed archival light-level geolocators across their breeding range in Michigan. We recovered devices from 27 males and analyzed light-level data within a Bayesian framework. We found that most males wintered in the central Bahamas and exhibited a loop migration pattern. In both fall and spring, departure date was the strongest predictor of arrival date, but in spring, stopover duration and migration distance were also important. Though stopover strategies varied, males spent the majority of their spring migration at stopover sites, several of which were located just before or after large ecological barriers. We argue that loop migration is likely a response to seasonal variation in prevailing winds. By documenting a tight link between spring departure and arrival dates, we provide a plausible mechanism for previously documented carry-over effects of winter rainfall on reproductive success in this species. The migratory periods remain the least understood periods for all birds, but by describing Kirtland's warbler migration routes and timing, and identifying locations of stopover sites, we have begun the process of better understanding the dynamics of their full annual cycle. Moreover, we have provided managers with valuable information on which to base future conservation and research priorities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Cooper","given":"Nathan W."},{"family":"Hallworth","given":"Michael T."},{"family":"Marra","given":"Peter P."}],"citation-key":"cooper2017jab","container-title":"Journal of Avian Biology","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jav.01096","ISSN":"1600-048X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jav.01096","page":"209-219","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Light-level geolocation reveals wintering distribution, migration routes, and primary stopover locations of an endangered long-distance migratory songbird","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jav.01096","volume":"48"},

  {"id":"danielkissling2014br","abstract":"Radio telemetry has been widely used to study the space use and movement behaviour of vertebrates, but transmitter sizes have only recently become small enough to allow tracking of insects under natural field conditions. Here, we review the available literature on insect telemetry using active (battery-powered) radio transmitters and compare this technology to harmonic radar and radio frequency identification (RFID) which use passive tags (i.e. without a battery). The first radio telemetry studies with insects were published in the late 1980s, and subsequent studies have addressed aspects of insect ecology, behaviour and evolution. Most insect telemetry studies have focused on habitat use and movement, including quantification of movement paths, home range sizes, habitat selection, and movement distances. Fewer studies have addressed foraging behaviour, activity patterns, migratory strategies, or evolutionary aspects. The majority of radio telemetry studies have been conducted outside the tropics, usually with beetles (Coleoptera) and crickets (Orthoptera), but bees (Hymenoptera), dobsonflies (Megaloptera), and dragonflies (Odonata) have also been radio-tracked. In contrast to the active transmitters used in radio telemetry, the much lower weight of harmonic radar and RFID tags allows them to be used with a broader range of insect taxa. However, the fixed detection zone of a stationary radar unit (< 1 km diameter) and the restricted detection distance of RFID tags (usually < 1-5 m) constitute major constraints of these technologies compared to radio telemetry. Most of the active transmitters in radio telemetry have been applied to insects with a body mass exceeding 1 g, but smaller species in the range 0.2-0.5 g (e.g. bumblebees and orchid bees) have now also been tracked. Current challenges of radio-tracking insects in the field are related to the constraints of a small transmitter, including short battery life (7-21 days), limited tracking range on the ground (100-500 m), and a transmitter weight that sometimes approaches the weight of a given insect (the ratio of tag mass to body mass varies from 2 to 100%). The attachment of radio transmitters may constrain insect behaviour and incur significant energetic costs, but few studies have addressed this in detail. Future radio telemetry studies should address (i) a larger number of species from different insect families and functional groups, (ii) a better coverage of tropical regions, (iii) intraspecific variability between sexes, ages, castes, and individuals, and (iv) a larger tracking range via aerial surveys with helicopters and aeroplanes equipped with external antennae. Furthermore, field and laboratory studies, including observational and experimental approaches as well as theoretical modelling, could help to clarify the behavioural and energetic consequences of transmitter attachment. Finally, the development of commercially available systems for automated tracking and potential future options of insect telemetry from space will provide exciting new avenues for quantifying movement and space use of insects from local to global spatial scales.

  {"id":"dawson2001jbr","abstract":"This review examines how birds use the annual cycle in photoperiod to ensure that seasonal events--breeding, molt, and song production--happen at the appropriate time of year. Differences in breeding strategies between birds and mammals reflect basic differences in biology. Avian breeding seasons tend to be of shorter duration and more asymmetric with respect to changes in photoperiod. Breeding seasons can occur at the same time each year (predictable) or at different times (opportunistic), depending on the food resource. In all cases, there is evidence for involvement of photoperiodic control, nonphotoperiodic control, and endogenous circannual rhythmicity. In predictable breeders (most nontropical species), photoperiod is the predominant proximate factor. Increasing photoperiods of spring stimulate secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and consequent gonadal maturation. However, breeding ends before the return of short photoperiods. This is the consequence of a second effect of long photoperiods--the induction of photorefractoriness. This dual role of long photoperiods is required to impart the asymmetry in breeding seasons. Typically, gonadal regression through photorefractoriness is associated with a massive decrease in hypothalamic GnRH, essentially a reversal to a pre-pubertal condition. Although breeding seasons are primarily determined by photoperiodic control of GnRH neurons, prolactin may be important in determining the exact timing of gonadal regression. In tropical and opportunistic breeders, endogenous circannual rhythmicity may be more important. In such species, the reproductive system remains in a state of \"readiness to breed\" for a large part of the year, with nonphotic cues acting as proximate cues to time breeding. Circannual rhythmicity may result from a temporal sequence of different physiological states rather than a molecular or cellular mechanism as in circadian rhythmicity. Avian homologues of mammalian clock genes Per2, Per3, Clock, bmal1, and MOP4 have been cloned. At the molecular level, avian circadian clocks appear to function in a similar manner to those of mammals. Photoperiodic time measurement involves interaction between a circadian rhythm of photoinducibility and, unlike mammals, deep brain photoreceptors. The exact location of these remains unclear. Although the eyes and pineal generate a daily cycle in melatonin, this photoperiodic signal is not used to time seasonal breeding. Instead, photoperiodic responses appear to involve direct interaction between photoreceptors and GnRH neurons. Thyroid hormones are required in some way for this system to function. In addition to gonadal function, song production is also affected by photoperiod. Several of the nuclei involved in the song system show seasonal changes in volume, greater in spring than in the fall. The increase in volume is, in part, due to an increase in cell number as a result of neurogenesis. There is no seasonal change in the birth of neurons but rather in their survival. Testosterone and melatonin appear to work antagonistically in regulating volume.","author":[{"family":"Dawson","given":"A."},{"family":"King","given":"V. M."},{"family":"Bentley","given":"G.

Magnetometers measure the Earth’s magnetic field, which has been shown to be one of the cues that long-distance migratory birds use for navigation. A magnetometer on a tracking tag collects data in a coordinate frame that is fixed to the body of the bird, but constantly changes orientation with the movement of the bird. Locational information on the same tag is however typically collected in an Earth-based coordinate frame. Using the information from both GPS and magnetometer we propose an algorithm for 4D transformation of magnetic measurements into the Earth-based frame, so that they can be used for analysis of behavioural movement responses to local magnetic conditions.","author":[{"family":"Demšar","given":"Urška"}],"citation-key":"demsar20192aicgis","container-title":"The 22nd AGILE International Conference on Geographic Information Science","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"title":"Investigating geomagnetic bird navigation: 4D data fusion of co-located GPS and magnetometer data","type":"paper-conference"},

Yet it is remarkably difﬁcult to infer group membership in migrating animals without being able to directly observe them. Here, we use novel lightweight atmospheric pressure loggers to monitor group dynamics in a small migratory bird, the European bee-eater (Merops apiaster). We present the ﬁrst evidence of a migratory bird ﬂying together with non-kin of different ages and sexes at all stages of the life cycle. In fact, 49% stay together throughout the annual cycle, never separating longer than 5 days at a time despite the  14,000-km journey. Of those that separated for longer, 89% reunited within less than a month with individuals they had previously spent time with, having ﬂown up to 5,000 km apart. These birds were not only using the same non-breeding sites, but also displayed coordinated foraging behaviors—these are unlikely to result from chance encounters in response to the same environmental conditions alone. Better understanding of migratory group dynamics, using the presented methods, could help improve our understanding of collective decision making during largescale movements.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Dhanjal-Adams","given":"Kiran L."},{"family":"Bauer","given":"Silke"},{"family":"Emmenegger","given":"Tamara"},{"family":"Hahn","given":"Steffen"},{"family":"Lisovski","given":"Simeon"},{"family":"Liechti","given":"Felix"}],"citation-key":"dhanjal-adams2018cba","container-title":"Current Biology","container-title-short":"Current Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.cub.2018.06.054","ISSN":"09609822","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9]]},"language":"en","page":"2824-2830.e3","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Spatiotemporal Group Dynamics in a Long-Distance Migratory Bird","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982218308455","volume":"28"},

The proposed model breaks down the errors contributed by individual components, then determines error elimination methods based on sensor behavior and characteristics, and finally constructs a feedback loop for continuous self-calibration. Measurement errors are reduced by adopting a systematic design methodology: 1) tilt errors are minimized through a careful selection of A/D convertor resolution and by making compensation on sensor bias and scale factor; 2) heading errors are reduced by cancelling out nearby ferrous distortions and making tilt-compensation on the magnetometer; 3) errors from gyroscope measurements are eliminated via the least squares algorithm and continuous corrections using orientation data at the steady-state position. Preliminary tests for low-g motion sensing show that the motion tracker can achieve less than plusmn0.5deg accuracy in tilt and less than plusmn1deg accuracy in yaw angle measurement with above-mentioned methods.","author":[{"family":"Dong","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Lim","given":"Kwang"},{"family":"Goh","given":"Young"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Kim-Doang"},{"family":"Chen","given":"I-Ming"},{"family":"Yeo","given":"Song"},{"family":"Duh","given":"Henry"}],"citation-key":"dong2008","DOI":"10.1109/ROBOT.2008.4543226","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,5,1]]},"page":"311-316","source":"ResearchGate","title":"A low-cost motion tracker and its error analysis","type":"paper-conference"},
  {"id":"dor2012jh","abstract":"Speciation processes are largely determined by the relative strength of divergent selection versus the magnitude of gene flow. The barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) has a broad geographic distribution that encompasses substantial geographic variation in morphology and behavior. The European (H. r. rustica) and East-Mediterranean (H. r. transitiva) subspecies are closely related, despite differing in morphological and life-history traits. To explore patterns of genetic differentiation and gene flow, we compared morphological and genetic variation among the nonmigratory breeding population of H. r. transitiva from Israel and the migratory population of H. r. rustica that passes through Israel and compared it with the genetic differentiation between H. r. transitiva from Israel and a breeding population of H. r. rustica from the United Kingdom that uses a different migratory flyway. Mitochondrial haplotype network analysis suggests that the European and East-Mediterranean populations are intermixed, although there was low but significant genetic differentiation between the subspecies based on both mitochondrial (FST = 0.025-0.033) and microsatellite (FST = 0.009-0.014) loci. Coalescent-based analyses suggest recent divergence and substantial gene flow between these populations despite their differences in morphological and behavioral traits. The results suggest that these subspecies are undergoing a differentiation process in the face of gene flow, with selection possibly operating on sexually selected traits. © The American Genetic Association. 2011.

  {"id":"dreelin2018fee","abstract":"Swallows and martins (Aves: Hirundinidae) are well-studied with respect to their breeding biology, but major aspects of their individual aerial movement behavior and ecology are poorly understood. Atmospheric conditions can strongly influence both the availability and distribution of flying insects that aerial insectivores rely upon. Because aerial insects are often found in distinct clusters within the aerosphere, we wanted to explore whether aerial insectivore flight altitudes were species-specific and if they were associated with atmospheric conditions. We examined these questions with novel tag technology, an altitude datalogger, on breeding populations of Purple Martin (Progne subis), Tree Swallow (Tachycineta bicolor), and Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica) in upstate New York during the summer of 2016, providing individual-level flight data on a per minute basis. Using mixed models, we investigated differences in flight altitudes between individuals, species, and varying atmospheric conditions. The major findings were that individuals of each species spent significantly different proportions of their time throughout the day in different aerial strata. In addition, higher flying species such as Purple Martins and Tree Swallows responded positively to greater thermal uplift whereas this predictor had no effect on Barn Swallow flight altitudes. Finally, the differing relationships for all species between their flight altitudes and weather variables suggest that each species may use different atmospheric cues for tracking their environment and/or prey. More research spanning greater time scales and a wider range of atmospheric conditions is needed to determine these relationships in finer detail. We encourage broader use of this or similar methodologies to better understand the behavior and ecology of aerial insectivores globally.","author":[{"family":"Dreelin","given":"R Andrew"},{"family":"Shipley","given":"J Ryan"},{"family":"Winkler","given":"David W"}],"citation-key":"dreelin2018fee","container-title":"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.3389/fevo.2018.00182","issue":"NOV","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"page":"182-182","title":"Flight behavior of individual aerial insectivores revealed by novel altitudinal dataloggers","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"dujon2014mee","abstract":"Over recent years, a major breakthrough in marine animal tracking has occurred with the advent of Fastloc-GPS that provides highly accurate location data even for animals that only surface briefly such as sea turtles, marine mammals and penguins. We assessed the accuracy of Fastloc-GPS locations using fixed trials of tags in which >45 000 locations were obtained. Procedures for determining the speed of travel and heading were developed by simulating tracks and then adding Fastloc-GPS location errors. The levels of detail achievable for speed and heading estimates were illustrated by using empirical Fastloc-GPS data for a green turtle (Chelonia mydas, Linnaeus, 1758) travelling over 3000 km across the Indian Ocean. The accuracy of Fastloc-GPS locations varied as a function of the number of GPS satellites used in the location calculation. For example, when Fastloc-GPS locations were calculated using 4 GPS satellites, 50% of locations were within 36 m and 95% within 724 m of the true position. These values improved to 18 and 70 m, respectively, when 6 satellites were used. Simulations indicated that for animals travelling around 2·5 km h-1 (e.g. turtles, penguins and seals) and depending on the number of satellites used in the location calculation, robust speed and heading estimates would usually be obtained for locations only 1-6 h apart. Fastloc-GPS accuracy is several orders of magnitude better that conventional Argos tracking or light-based geolocation and consequently will allow new insights into small-scale movement patterns of marine animals.","author":[{"family":"Dujon","given":"Antoine M"},{"family":"Lindstrom","given":"R Todd"},{"family":"Hays","given":"Graeme C"}],"citation-key":"dujon2014mee","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.12286","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"page":"1162-1169","title":"The accuracy of Fastloc-GPS locations and implications for animal tracking","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},

In the polarization-based robotic vision, most of the sensors used so far comprise high-definition CCD or CMOS cameras topped with linear polarizers. Here, we present a 2-pixel polarization-sensitive visual sensor, which was strongly inspired by the dorsal rim area of desert ants' compound eyes, designed to determine the direction of polarization of the skylight. The spectral sensitivity of this minimalistic sensor, which requires no lenses, is in the ultraviolet range. Five different methods of computing the direction of polarization were implemented and tested here. Our own methods, the extended and AntBot method, outperformed the other three, giving a mean angular error of only 0.62° ± 0.40° (median: 0.24°) and 0.69° ± 0.52° (median: 0.39°), respectively (mean ± standard deviation).

This shape is dis- tinctive, can be located reliably in measured data, and provides a firm theoretical basis for animal geolocation by template-fitting to irradiance data. The resulting approach matches a theoretical model of the irradiance vs. time-of-day to the relevant portion of a given day’s data, adjusting parameters for latitude, longitude, and cloudiness. In favorable cases, there is only one parameter choice that will fit well, and that choice becomes the position estimate. The entire process can proceed automatically in a tag. Theoretical estimates predict good accuracy over most of the year and most of the earth, with difficulties just on the winter side of equinox and near the equator.

The calibration is based on a 458-day set of blue-light irradiance data taken by an archival tag (Lotek LTD750) at a known location on land (48.57°N, 122.94°W). For the data studied, median values of the estimated daily standard deviations were 0.42° in longitude, 0.95° in latitude. The error estimates include the effects of weather and other data noise, latitude, and season, so (1) they vary widely from day to day and with season, and (2) they can be cautiously expected to remain valid in situations other than the particular one tested.

  {"id":"eure2013","abstract":"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are playing an increasing role in aviation. Various methods exist for the computation of UAV attitude based on low cost microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers. There has been a recent increase in UAV autonomy as sensors are becoming more compact and onboard processing power has increased significantly. Correct UAV attitude estimation will play a critical role in navigation and separation assurance as UAVs share airspace with civil air traffic. This paper describes attitude estimation derived by post-processing data from a small low cost Inertial Navigation System (INS) recorded during the flight of a subscale commercial off the shelf (COTS) UAV. Two discrete time attitude estimation schemes are presented here in detail. The first is an adaptation of the Kalman Filter to accommodate nonlinear systems, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The EKF returns quaternion estimates of the UAV attitude based on MEMS gyro, magnetometer, accelerometer, and pitot tube inputs. The second scheme is the complementary filter which is a simpler algorithm that splits the sensor frequency spectrum based on noise characteristics. The necessity to correct both filters for gravity measurement errors during turning maneuvers is demonstrated. It is shown that the proposed algorithms may be used to estimate UAV attitude. The effects of vibration on sensor measurements are discussed. Heuristic tuning comments pertaining to sensor filtering and gain selection to achieve acceptable performance during flight are given. Comparisons of attitude estimation performance are made between the EKF and the complementary filter.","author":[{"family":"Eure","given":"Kenneth W."},{"family":"Quach","given":"Cuong Chi"},{"family":"Vazquez","given":"Sixto L."},{"family":"Hogge","given":"Edward F."},{"family":"Hill","given":"Boyd L."}],"citation-key":"eure2013","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"title":"An Application of UAV Attitude Estimation Using a Low-Cost Inertial Navigation System","type":"report"},

Changes in SCN function have pronounced consequences for behaviour and physiology; however, few studies have examined whether individual differences in circadian behaviour reflect changes in SCN function. Here, PERIOD2::LUCIFERASE mice were exposed to a behavioural assay to characterize individual differences in baseline entrainment, rate of re-entrainment and free-running rhythms. SCN slices were then collected for ex vivo bioluminescence imaging to gain insight into how the properties of the SCN clock influence individual differences in behavioural rhythms. First, individual differences in the timing of locomotor activity rhythms were positively correlated with the timing of SCN rhythms. Second, slower adjustment during simulated jetlag was associated with a larger degree of phase heterogeneity among SCN neurons. Collectively, these findings highlight the roleof the SCN network in determining individual differences in circadian behaviour. Furthermore, these results reveal novel ways that the network organization of the SCN influences plasticity at the behavioural level, and lend insight into potential interventions designed to modulate the rate of resynchronization during transmeridian travel and shift work.","author":[{"family":"Evans","given":"Jennifer A"},{"family":"Evans","given":"Jennifer A"},{"family":"Castanon-Cervantes","given":"Oscar"},{"family":"Davidson","given":"Alec J."}],"citation-key":"evans2015prsbbs","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2015.0769","issue":"1810","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"page":"20150769-20150769","title":"Neural correlates of individual differences in circadian behaviour","type":"article-journal","volume":"282"},

  {"id":"fang2006iamito","abstract":"In this paper, we combine inertial sensing and sensor network technology to create a pedestrian dead reckoning system. The core of the system is a lightweight sensor-and-wireless-embedded device called NavMote that is carried by a pedestrian. The NavMote gathers information about pedestrian motion from an integrated magnetic compass and accelerometers. When the NavMote comes within range of a sensor network (composed of NetMotes), it downloads the compressed data to the network. The network relays the data via a RelayMote to an information center where the data are processed into an estimate of the pedestrian trajectory based on a dead reckoning algorithm. System details including the NavMote hardware/software, sensor network middleware services, and the dead reckoning algorithm are provided. In particular, simple but effective step detection and step length estimation methods are implemented in order to reduce computation, memory, and communication requirements on the Motes. Static and dynamic calibrations of the compass data are crucial to compensate the heading errors. The dead reckoning performance is further enhanced by wireless telemetry and map matching. Extensive testing results show that satisfactory tracking performance with relatively long operational time is achieved.

We evaluate the Mantel test as a metric of migratory connectivity, and explore the extent to which variance in population spread can be explained simply by geography. The mean distance between two individuals from the same population during the non-breeding season was 743 km, covering 10–20% of the maximum width of Africa/South America. Individuals from different breeding populations tended to mix during the non-breeding season, although spatial segregation was maintained in species with relatively large non-breeding ranges (and, to a lesser extent, those with low population-level spread). A substantial amount of between-population variation in population spread was predicted simply by geography, with populations using non-breeding zones with limited land availability (e.g. Central America compared to South America) showing lower population spread. The high levels of population spread suggest that deterministic migration tactics are not generally adaptive; this makes sense in the context of the recent evolution of the systems, and the spatial and temporal unpredictability of non-breeding habitat. The conservation implications of generally low connectivity are that the loss (or protection) of any non-breeding site will have a diffuse but widespread effect on many breeding populations. Although low connectivity should engender population resilience to shifts in habitat (e.g. due to climate change), we suggest it may increase susceptibility to habitat loss. We hypothesize that, because a migrant species cannot adapt to both simultaneously, migrants generally may be more susceptible to population declines in the face of concurrent anthropogenic habitat and climate change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Finch","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Butler","given":"Simon J."},{"family":"Franco","given":"Aldina M.

  {"id":"friesen2007pnasusa","abstract":"The importance of sympatric speciation (the evolution of reproductive isolation between codistributed populations) in generating biodiversity is highly controversial. Whereas potential examples of sympatric speciation exist for plants, insects, and fishes, most theoretical models suggest that it requires conditions that are probably not common in nature, and only two possible cases have been described for tetrapods. One mechanism by which it could occur is through allochronic isolation - separation of populations by breeding time. Oceanodroma castro (the Madeiran or bandrumped storm-petrel) is a small seabird that nests on tropical and subtropical islands throughout the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In at least five archipelagos, different individuals breed on the same islands in different seasons. We compared variation in five microsatellite loci and the mitochondrial control region among 562 O. castro from throughout the species' range. We found that sympatric seasonal populations differ genetically within all five archipelagos and have ceased to exchange genes in two. Population and gene trees all indicate that seasonal populations within four of the archipelagos are more closely related to each other than to populations from the same season from other archipelagos; divergence of the fifth sympatric pair is too ancient for reliable inference. Thus, seasonal populations appear to have arisen sympatrically at least four times. This is the first evidence for sympatric speciation by allochrony in a tetrapod, and adds to growing indications that population differentiation and speciation can occur without geographic barriers to gene flow. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","author":[{"family":"Friesen","given":"V L"},{"family":"Smith","given":"A L"},{"family":"Gómez-Díaz","given":"E."},{"family":"Bolton","given":"M."},{"family":"Furness","given":"R W"},{"family":"González-Solís","given":"J."},{"family":"Monteiro","given":"L.

Although geolocators are extensively used on animals at sea, little is known about how accurate geolocators are for tracking terrestrial or forest-dwelling migrants. To test the accuracy of geolocators for tracking migratory songbirds living in forested habitat, we calibrated geolocators to a source population located in central Europe and collected location estimates based on the source population calibration from stationary geolocators deployed over an 800km NE to SW gradient in Western Europe. Additionally, we fit non-migratory songbirds (European blackbirds, Turdus merula) with geolocators for 12months to compare known locations of individuals with locations estimated by geolocators. We found an average error ±95% CI of 201±43km in latitude for stationary geolocators in forest habitat. Longitude error was considerably lower (12±03km). The most accurate geolocator was on average 23km off target, the worst was on average 390km off. The winter latitude estimate error for geolocators deployed on sedentary birds was on average (±95% CI) 143±62km when geolocators were calibrated during the breeding season and 132±75km when they were calibrated during the winter. Longitude error for geolocators deployed on birds was on average (±95% CI) 50±34km. Although we found error most likely due to seasonal changes in habitat and behaviour, our results indicate that geolocators can be used to reliably track long-distance forest-dwelling migrants. We also found that the low degree of error for longitude estimates attained from geolocators makes this technology suitable for identifying relatively short-distance movements in longitude. © 2011 The Authors.

  {"id":"fudickar2017fee","abstract":"The colonization of urban environments by animals is often accompanied by earlier breeding and associated changes in seasonal schedules. Accelerated timing of seasonal reproduction in derived urban populations is a potential cause of evolutionary divergence from ancestral populations if differences in physiological processes that regulate reproductive timing become fixed over time. We compared reproductive development in free-living and captive male dark-eyed juncos deriving from a population that recently colonized a city (~35 years) and ceased migrating to that of conspecifics that live in sympatry with the urban population during winter and spring but migrate elsewhere to breed. We predicted that the earlier breeding sedentary urban birds would exhibit accelerated reproductive development along the hypothalamic-pituitary (HPG) axis as compared to migrants. We found that free-living sedentary urban and migrant juncos differed at the level of the pituitary when measured as baseline luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, but not in increased LH when challenged with Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH). Among captives held in a common garden, and at the level of the gonad, we found that sedentary urban birds produced more testosterone in response to GnRH than migrants living in the same common environment, suggesting greater gonadal sensitivity in the derived urban population. Greater gonadal sensitivity could arise from greater upstream activation by LH or FSH or from reduced suppression of gonadal development by the adrenal axis. We compared abundance of gonadal transcripts for LH receptor (LHR), follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in the common-garden, predicting either more abundant transcripts for LHR and FSHR or fewer transcripts for GR and MR in the earlier breeding sedentary urban breeders, as compared to the migrants. We found no difference in the expression of these genes. Together the data suggest that advanced timing of reproduction in a recently derived urban population is facilitated by earlier increase in upstream baseline activity of the HPG and earlier release from gonadal suppression by yet-to-be-discovered mechanisms. Evolutionarily, our results suggest that potential for gene flow between seasonally sympatric populations may be limited due to urban-induced advances in the timing of reproduction and resulting allochrony","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Fudickar","given":"Adam M."},{"family":"Greives","given":"Timothy J."},{"family":"Abolins-Abols","given":"Mikus"},{"family":"Atwell","given":"Jonathan W."},{"family":"Meddle","given":"Simone L."},{"family":"Friis","given":"Guillermo"},{"family":"Stricker","given":"Craig A."},{"family":"Ketterson","given":"Ellen D."}],"citation-key":"fudickar2017fee","container-title":"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Front.

A key question is how the rate of this micro-evolutionary change compares with the rate of environmental change, given that theoretically there is a 'critical rate of environmental change' beyond which increased maladaptation leads to population extinction. Here, we parametrize two closely related models to predict this critical rate using data from a long-term study of great tits (Parus major). We used stochastic dynamic programming to predict changes in optimal breeding time under three different climate scenarios. Using these results we parametrized two theoretical models to predict critical rates. Results from both models agreed qualitatively in that even 'mild' rates of climate change would be close to these critical rates with respect to great tit breeding time, while for scenarios close to the upper limit of IPCC climate projections the calculated critical rates would be clearly exceeded with possible consequences for population persistence. We therefore tentatively conclude that microevolution, together with plasticity, would rescue only the population from mild rates of climate change, although the models make many simplifying assumptions that remain to be tested. © 2012 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

  {"id":"gill2013prsbbs","abstract":"Recent advances in spring arrival dates have been reported in many migratory species but the mechanism driving these advances is unknown. As population declines are most widely reported in species that are not advancing migration, there is an urgent need to identify the mechanisms facilitating and constraining these advances. Individual plasticity in timing of migration in response to changing climatic conditions is commonly proposed to drive these advances but plasticity in individual migratory timings is rarely observed. For a shorebird population that has significantly advanced migration in recent decades, we show that individual arrival dates are highly consistent between years, but that the arrival dates of newrecruits to the population are significantly earlier now than in previous years. Several mechanisms could drive advances in recruit arrival, none of which require individual plasticity or rapid evolution of migration timings. In particular, advances in nest-laying dates could result in advanced recruit arrival, if benefits of early hatching facilitate early subsequent spring migration. This mechanism could also explain why arrival dates of short-distance migrants, which generally return to breeding sites earlier and have greater scope for advance laying, are advancing more rapidly than long-distance migrants. © 2013 The Authors.","author":[{"family":"Gill","given":"Jennifer A"},{"family":"Alves","given":"José A"},{"family":"Sutherland","given":"William J."},{"family":"Appleton","given":"Graham F."},{"family":"Potts","given":"Peter M"},{"family":"Gunnarsson","given":"Tómas G"}],"citation-key":"gill2013prsbbs","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2013.2161","issue":"1774","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"page":"20132161-20132161","title":"Why is timing of bird migration advancing when individuals are not?","type":"article-journal","volume":"281"},
  {"id":"gleiss2011mee","abstract":"1. The energetic costs of different behaviours are critical in modulating the behavioural ecology of free-living animals. Despite this, measurement of energy expenditure in the field has proved difficult. 2. A new method with broad application for field studies has been proposed for determining the rate at which animals expend energy, based on measurements of overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) through the attachment of miniature acceleration data-loggers. This technique is easy to implement and has the promise to be able to resolve energy expenditure with fine (sub-second) temporal resolution, making it the only method which promises to able to determine the cost of short-lived behaviours. Increasing evidence supports the validity of the approach although the rationale behind it is vague. 3. This study explores link between metabolic energy and acceleration by examining what is known about how muscular tissue converts metabolic energy to mechanical work via muscular contraction and how Newtonian physics facilitates a derivation of Power (the rate at which work is performed) from acceleration. The link between metabolic energy and acceleration appears to involve three discrete processes: (i) the ratio of mechanical work to metabolic work performed by a single muscle (mechano-chemical efficiency); (ii) the ratio of external and internal work performed (mechanical work of the limbs in relation to that of the centre of mass); and (iii) the ratio of inertial to de novo mechanical work. These processes may vary according to the animal’s mass, the medium in which it travels and its gait or behaviour. 4. Assessment of movement has limited application in defining non-movement energy expenditure such as that involved in specific dynamic action or non-shivering thermogenesis. However, this non-movement energy expenditure may often be modelled with reasonable confidence.

Compasses are typically arranged in hierarchies, with magnetic backup as a last resort when celestial information is unavailable. Magnetic information is often essential to calibrating celestial cues, though, and repeated recalibration between celestial and magnetic compasses is important in many species. Most magnetic compasses are based on magnetite crystals, but others make use of induction or paramagnetic interactions between short-wavelength light and visual pigments. Though odors may be used in some cases, most if not all long-range maps probably depend on magnetite.

  {"id":"graham2019me","abstract":"Annual reproductive success is often highest in individuals that initiate breeding early, yet relatively few individuals start breeding during this apparently optimal time. This suggests that individuals, particularly females who ultimately dictate when offspring are born, incur costs by initiating reproduction early in the season. We hypothesized that increases in the ageing rate of somatic cells may be one such cost. Telomeres, the repetitive DNA sequences on the ends of chromosomes, may be good proxies of biological wear and tear as they shorten with age and in response to stress. Using historical data from a long-term study population of dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis), we found that telomere loss between years was greater in earlier breeding females, regardless of chronological age. There was no relationship between telomere loss and the annual number of eggs laid or chicks that reached independence. However, telomere loss was greater when temperatures were cooler, and cooler temperatures generally occur early in the season. This suggests that environmental conditions could be the primary cause of accelerated telomere loss in early breeders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Graham","given":"Jessica L."},{"family":"Bauer","given":"Carolyn M."},{"family":"Heidinger","given":"Britt J."},{"family":"Ketterson","given":"Ellen D."},{"family":"Greives","given":"Timothy J."}],"citation-key":"graham2019me","container-title":"Molecular Ecology","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.14952","ISSN":"1365-294X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mec.14952","page":"114-126","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Early-breeding females experience greater telomere loss","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.14952","volume":"28"},
  {"id":"greives2016gce","abstract":"To optimally time reproduction, animals must coordinate changes in the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. The extent of intra-species variation in seasonal timing of reproductive function is considerable, both within and among populations. Dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis) populations are known to differ in their reproductive timing response to cues experienced in the same habitat in late winter/early spring. Specifically in juncos cohabitating on shared wintering grounds, residents initiate breeding and reproductive activity but migrants delay reproductive development and prepare to migrate before breeding. Here, we test the hypothesis that the pituitary gland acts as a 'control point' to modulate differential HPG axis activity across populations. We sampled free-living resident and migrant juncos on their shared over-wintering grounds in March, thus all individuals were experiencing the same environmental cues, including photoperiod. We predicted that during this critical time of transition, residents would more readily respond to repeated gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation with increases in luteinizing hormone (LH), in contrast to migrants, which should delay full reproductive activity. Our data indicate that migrant females, while still on the overwintering grounds, have a reduced LH response to repeated GnRH injections compared to resident females. Male migrant and resident birds did not differ in their responsiveness to repeated GnRH. Our results suggest a sex difference in the costs of mistimed activation of the HPG axis, with female migrants being less responsive than residents females and males to repeated stimulation. Further, our data implicate a key role for the pituitary in regulating appropriate reproductive timing responses.","author":[{"family":"Greives","given":"Timothy J."},{"family":"Fudickar","given":"Adam M."},{"family":"Atwell","given":"Jonathan W."},{"family":"Meddle","given":"Simone L."},{"family":"Ketterson","given":"Ellen D."}],"citation-key":"greives2016gce","container-title":"General and Comparative Endocrinology","container-title-short":"Gen Comp Endocrinol","DOI":"10.1016/j.ygcen.2016.06.031","ISSN":"1095-6840","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,15]]},"language":"eng","page":"17-23","PMCID":"PMC5036536","PMID":"27374492","source":"PubMed","title":"Early spring sex differences in luteinizing hormone response to gonadotropin releasing hormone in co-occurring resident and migrant dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis)","type":"article-journal","volume":"236"},

It consists of a class of motion models and a general nonlinear measurement equation in position. A general algorithm is presented, which is parsimonious with the particle dimension. It is based on marginalization, enabling a Kalman filter to estimate all position derivatives, and the particle filter becomes low dimensional. This is of utmost importance for high-performance real-time applications. Automotive and airborne applications illustrate numerically the advantage over classical Kalman filter-based algorithms. Here, the use of nonlinear models and non-Gaussian noise is the main explanation for the improvement in accuracy. More specifically, we describe how the technique of map matching is used to match an aircraft's elevation profile to a digital elevation map and a car's horizontal driven path to a street map. In both cases, real-time implementations are available, and tests have shown that the accuracy in both cases is comparable with satellite navigation (as GPS) but with higher integrity. Based on simulations, we also argue how the particle filter can be used for positioning based on cellular phone measurements, for integrated navigation in aircraft, and for target tracking in aircraft and cars. Finally, the particle filter enables a promising solution to the combined task of navigation and tracking, with possible application to airborne hunting and collision avoidance systems in cars.","author":[{"family":"Gustafsson","given":"F"},{"family":"Gunnarsson","given":"F"},{"family":"Bergman","given":"N"},{"family":"Forssell","given":"U"},{"family":"Jansson","given":"J"},{"family":"Karlsson","given":"R"},{"family":"Nordlund","given":"P -."}],"citation-key":"gustafsson2002itsp","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","DOI":"10.1109/78.978396","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"page":"425-437","title":"Particle filters for positioning, navigation, and tracking","type":"article-journal","volume":"50"},

  {"id":"hamilton1967ab","abstract":"Fox sparrows in registration cages exhibit migratory activity which is correlated with the normal season of migration. Detailed analysis of the temporal pattern of activity of a single bird indicates that this migratory activity is composed of rhythmical bouts of locomotion. In the early hours of the evening bursts of activity are arhythmical and probably correlated with preening activities which anticipate normal migratory movements. Later in the evening the activity becomes highly rhythmical, the length of the rhythm varying seasonally and through the night. The periodicity may range from 30 sec or more to a frequency such that the activity bouts merge with one another and activity is continuous. This rhythmical activity proceeds very evenly throughout the rest of the night. The analyses reported here were made in June, after the normal migration had ended and breeding activity was well under way. The heaviest migratory activity of caged birds occurs as a continuous performance in which the bout structure is not apparent. Only as the activity slows can the activity rhythm be behaviourally distinguished. It is suggested that these rhythms may have a neuronal basis and that a continuous performance of activity which is apparently arhythmical may have a rhythmical neuronal correlate. The migratory bird in flight may be urged on by rhythmical nervous discharge. Environmental factors end both the evening's flight and the migratory sojourn. In looking back to the earlier part of the season in which migratory activity in the caged bird is reflected by a continuous performance a question arises. Is it still possible to postulate a bout structure? If the hypothesis that the bouts are based upon rhythmical discharge of neuronal elements is correct, then it is possible that the discharge is occurring at a sufficiently frequent rate to elicit continuous behaviour. This may explain why rhythmicity emerges only after the level of activity is lowered enough to permit the emergence of inactive durations between activity bouts. © 1967.","author":[{"family":"Hamilton","given":"William J."}],"citation-key":"hamilton1967ab","container-title":"Animal Behaviour","DOI":"10.1016/0003-3472(67)90054-1","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1967]]},"page":"527-533","title":"Temporal pattern of nocturnal activity of a caged fox sparrow","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003347267900541","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"harrington2020ab","abstract":"Background:  Animals need adaptive strategies to cope with seasonal changes in prey availability to survive and reproduce, which can include migrating, prey-switching, or reducing metabolic needs. Human settlements can dis‑rupt spatiotemporal patterning in resource availability, which can affect animals’ foraging success, particularly for juve‑niles who are behaviorally developing and learning efficient foraging skills. Here, we investigate behavioral responses of juvenile striated caracaras, a near-threatened scavenging falconid, to seasonally migratory seabird prey and a farm settlement on Saunders Island, Falklands. We deployed accelerometer–GPS dataloggers (n = 27) to measure seasonal differences in daily and hourly vectorial dynamic body acceleration (VeDBA; an activity index measured in gravita‑tional g) and space use, and investigated seasonal variation in body mass of the tagged subset and an additional 65 caracaras.\nResults:  Juvenile caracaras were overall similarly active in winter and summer. However, during winter, caracaras made the most of limited daylight by increasing average daytime activity (winter males: 0.16 ± 0.03 g, summer males: 0.09 ± 0.01 g, winter females: 0.12 ± 0.02 g, summer females: 0.08 ± 0.01 g). During winter, both sexes increased the percentage of daylight spent in high activity (winter males: 35 ± 5%, summer males: 21 ± 3%, winter females: 25 ± 6%, summer females: 16 ± 3%, p < 0.001) and ranged nearly 4 times farther (95% kernel density estimate winter: 2.36 ± 0.96 km2, summer: 0.61 ± 0.20 km2; p < 0.001). Furthermore, on a daily scale, males were 21% more active than females year-round (24-h average VeDBA: males 0.07 ± 0.01 g, females 0.06 ± 0.01 g; p < 0.01). We did not observe a significant seasonal difference in mass.\nConclusion:  That caracaras’ daily activity and body mass did not vary between seasons suggests that wintering birds on Saunders are meeting resource requirements despite the absence of seasonally migratory prey. We hypothesize that human subsidies may mitigate the effect of seasonal food limitations. Further research should include studies on seasonal energetics to improve our understanding of baseline body condition, and comparative studies on other islands and including adults to understand the importance of human subsidies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Harrington","given":"Katie J."},{"family":"Fahlbusch","given":"James A."},{"family":"Langrock","given":"Roland"},{"family":"Therrien","given":"Jean-François"},{"family":"Houtz","given":"Jennifer L."},{"family":"McDonald","given":"Birgitte I."}],"citation-key":"harrington2020ab","container-title":"Animal Biotelemetry","container-title-short":"Anim Biotelemetry","DOI":"10.1186/s40317-020-00214-y","ISSN":"2050-3385","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12]]},"language":"en","page":"27","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Seasonal activity levels of a farm-island population of striated caracaras (Phalcoboenus australis) in the Falkland Islands","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://animalbiotelemetry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40317-020-00214-y","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"haug2005","abstract":"Nonlinear filtering is the process of estimating and tracking the state of a nonlinear stochastic system from non-Gaussian noisy observation data. In this technical memo- randum, we present an overview of techniques for nonlinear filtering for a wide variety of conditions on the nonlinearities and on the noise. We begin with the development of a general Bayesian approach to filtering which is applicable to all linear or nonlinear stochastic systems. We show how Bayesian filtering requires integration over probability density functions that cannot be accomplished in closed form for the general nonlinear, non-Gaussian multivariate system, so approximations are required. Next, we address the special case where both the dynamic and observation models are nonlinear but the noises are additive and Gaussian. The extended Kalman filter (EKF) has been the standard technique usually applied here. But, for severe nonlinearities, the EKF can be very un- stable and performs poorly. We show how to use the analytical expression for Gaussian densities to generate integral expressions for the mean and covariance matrices needed for the Kalman filter which include the nonlinearities directly inside the integrals. Several numerical techniques are presented that give approximate solutions for these integrals, including Gauss-Hermite quadrature, unscented filter, and Monte Carlo approximations. We then show how these numerically generated integral solutions can be used in a Kalman filter so as to avoid the direct evaluation of the Jacobian matrix associated with the ex- tended Kalman filter. For all filters, step-by-step block diagrams are used to illustrate the recursive implementation of each filter. To solve the fully nonlinear case, when the noise may be non-additive or non-Gaussian, we present several versions of particle filters that use importance sampling. Particle filters can be subdivided into two categories: those that re-use particles and require resampling to prevent divergence, and those that do not re-use particles and therefore require no resampling. For the first category, we show how the use of importance sampling, combined with particle re-use at each iteration, leads to the sequential importance sampling (SIS) particle filter and its special case, the bootstrap particle filter. The requirement for resampling is outlined and an efficient resampling scheme is presented. For the second class, we discuss a generic importance sampling par- ticle filter and then add specific implementations, including the Gaussian particle filter and combination particle filters that bring together the Gaussian particle filter, and ei- ther the Gauss-Hermite, unscented, or Monte Carlo Kalman filters developed above to specify a Gaussian importance density. When either the dynamic or observation models are linear, we show how the Rao-Blackwell simplifications can be applied to any of the filters presented to reduce computational costs. We then present results for two nonlinear tracking examples, one with additive Gaussian noise and one with non-Gaussian embed- ded noise. For each example, we apply the appropriate nonlinear filters and compare performance results.","author":[{"family":"Haug","given":"A. J."},{"family":"Huag","given":"A.

Such a mismatch is paradoxical, and it is not clear why geese might fly higher than is absolutely necessary. In addition, direct empirical measurements of high-altitude flight are lacking. We test whether migrating bar-headed geese actually minimize flight altitude and make use of favourable winds to reduce flight costs. By tracking 91 geese, we show that these birds typically travel through the valleys of the Himalayas and not over the summits. We report maximum flight altitudes of 7290 m and 6540 m for southbound and northbound geese, respectively, but with 95 per cent of locations received from less than 5489 m. Geese travelled along a route that was 112 km longer than the great circle (shortest distance) route, with transit ground speeds suggesting that they rarely profited from tailwinds. Bar-headed geese from these eastern populations generally travel only as high as the terrain beneath them dictates and rarely in profitable winds. Nevertheless, their migration represents an enormous challenge in conditions where humans and other mammals are only able to operate at levels well below their sea-level maxima.","author":[{"family":"Hawkes","given":"L A"},{"family":"Balachandran","given":"S"},{"family":"Batbayar","given":"N"},{"family":"Butler","given":"P J"},{"family":"Chua","given":"B."},{"family":"Douglas","given":"D.

Despite its origins in the 1960s, physiologging has evolved more slowly than its umbrella field of biologging. However, the recording of physiological metrics in free-living animals will be key to solving some of the greatest challenges in biodiversity conservation, issues pertaining to animal health and welfare, and for inspiring future therapeutic strategies for human health. Current physiologging technologies encompass the measurement of physiological variables such as heart rate, brain activity, body temperature, muscle stimulation and dynamic movement, yet future developments will allow for onboard logging of metrics relating to organelle, molecular and genetic function.\n            This article is part of the theme issue ‘Measuring physiology in free-living animals (Part II)’.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Hawkes","given":"L.

  {"id":"heath2012jab","abstract":"Global climate change has affected avian migration patterns and nesting phenology. Changes in one phase of a bird's cycle will most likely affect other stages, but few studies focus simultaneously on multiple life-history events. We used western North American ringing records and Christmas Bird Counts to examine whether changes in migration patterns were concordant with advancing American kestrel Falco sparverius nesting phenology. Consistent with previous findings, male kestrels migrated shorter distances than female kestrels, and kestrels nesting in southern latitudes migrated shorter distances than kestrels nesting in more northern areas. In addition, kestrel migration distance decreased significantly from 1960 to 2009 and was negatively associated with winter minimum temperatures. Christmas Birds Counts from the same time period showed increasing indices of overwintering kestrel abundance in northern states (Washington, Idaho, and Utah), where winter minimum temperatures have increased significantly, and concomitant decreases in southern states (California and Arizona). Finally, changes in nesting phenology of kestrels in southwestern Idaho were best explained by warmer winters, not springs. Warmer winters may decrease energetic demands on migrants by allowing for shorter migration distances, decreasing thermoregulatory costs, or both. Decreased energy demands during winter may allow birds to gain resources necessary for reproduction earlier in the nesting season. Higher winter temperatures that decrease (former) constraints on early nesting may be a particularly important mechanism leading to advancing nesting phenology for species with strong seasonal declines in fecundity or intense early season competition for high-quality nesting areas. © 2012 The Authors.

  {"id":"hedenstrom2016cb","abstract":"The common swift (Apus apus) is adapted to an aerial lifestyle, where food and nest material are captured in the air. Observations have prompted scientists to hypothesize that swifts stay airborne for their entire non-breeding period [1, 2], including migration into sub-Saharan Africa [3–5]. It is mainly juvenile common swifts that occasionally roost in trees or buildings before autumn migration when weather is bad [1, 6]. In contrast, the North American chimney swift (Chaetura pelagica) and Vaux's swift (C. vauxi) regularly settle to roost in places like chimneys and buildings during migration and winter [7, 8]. Observations of common swifts during the winter months are scarce, and roost sites have never been found in sub-Saharan Africa. In the breeding season, non-breeding individuals usually spend the night airborne [9], whereas adult nesting birds roost in the nest [1]. We equipped common swifts with a micro data logger with an accelerometer to record flight activity (years 1–2) and with a light-level sensor for geolocation (year 2). Our data show that swifts are airborne for >99% of the time during their 10-month non-breeding period; some individuals never settled, but occasional events of flight inactivity occurred in most individuals. Apparent flight activity was lower during the daytime than during the nighttime, most likely due to prolonged gliding episodes during the daytime when soaring in thermals. Our data also revealed that twilight ascents, previously observed during the summer [10], occur throughout the year. The results have important implications for understanding physiological adaptations to endure prolonged periods of flight, including the need to sleep while airborne.","author":[{"family":"Hedenström","given":"Anders"},{"family":"Norevik","given":"Gabriel"},{"family":"Warfvinge","given":"Kajsa"},{"family":"Andersson","given":"Arne"},{"family":"Bäckman","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Åkesson","given":"Susanne"}],"citation-key":"hedenstrom2016cb","container-title":"Current Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.cub.2016.09.014","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,11]]},"page":"3066-3070","title":"Annual 10-Month Aerial Life Phase in the Common Swift Apus apus","type":"article-journal","volume":"26"},
  {"id":"hedrick2004jeb","abstract":"Skip to Next Section\nWe used a combination of high-speed 3-D kinematics and three-axis accelerometer recordings obtained from cockatiels flying in a low-turbulence wind tunnel to characterize the instantaneous accelerations and, by extension, the net aerodynamic forces produced throughout the wingbeat cycle across a broad range of flight speeds (1–13 m s–1). Our goals were to investigate the variation in instantaneous aerodynamic force production during the wingbeat cycle of birds flying across a range of steady speeds, testing two predictions regarding aerodynamic force generation in upstroke and the commonly held assumption that all of the kinetic energy imparted to the wings of a bird in flapping flight is recovered as useful aerodynamic work. We found that cockatiels produce only a limited amount of lift during upstroke (14% of downstroke lift) at slower flight speeds (1–3 m s–1). Upstroke lift at intermediate flight speeds (7–11 m s–1) was moderate, averaging 39% of downstroke lift. Instantaneous aerodynamic forces were greatest near mid-downstroke. At the end of each half-stroke, during wing turnaround, aerodynamic forces were minimal, but inertial forces created by wing motion were large. However, we found that the inertial power requirements of downstroke (minimum of 0.29±0.10 W at 7 m s–1 and maximum of 0.56±0.13 W at 1 m s–1) were consistent with the assumption that nearly all wing kinetic energy in downstroke was applied to the production of aerodynamic forces and therefore should not be added separately to the overall power cost of flight. The inertial power requirements of upstroke (minimum of 0.16±0.04 W at 7 m s–1 and maximum of 0.35±0.11 W at 1 m s–1) cannot be recovered in a similar manner, but their magnitude was such that the power requirements for the upstroke musculature (minimum of 54±13 W kg–1 at 7 m s–1 and maximum of 122±35 W at 1 m s–1) fall within the established range for cockatiel flight muscle (<185 W kg–1).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Hedrick","given":"Tyson L."},{"family":"Usherwood","given":"James R."},{"family":"Biewener","given":"Andrew A."}],"citation-key":"hedrick2004jeb","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Biology","DOI":"10.1242/jeb.00933","ISSN":"0022-0949, 1477-9145","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,4,15]]},"language":"en","page":"1689-1702","PMID":"15073202","publisher":"The Company of Biologists Ltd","section":"Research Article","source":"jeb.biologists.org","title":"Wing inertia and whole-body acceleration: an analysis of instantaneous aerodynamic force production in cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus) flying across a range of speeds","title-short":"Wing inertia and whole-body acceleration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/10/1689","volume":"207"},
  {"id":"helm2010prsbbs","abstract":"Timing is essential, but circadian clocks, which play a crucial role in timekeeping, are almost unaddressed in evolutionary ecology. A key property of circadian clocks is their free-running period length (t), i.e. the time taken for a full cycle under constant conditions. Under laboratory conditions, concordance of twith the ambient light-dark cycle confers major fitness benefits, but little is known about period length and its implications in natural populations. We therefore studied natural variation of circadian traits in a songbird, the great tit (Parus major), by recording locomotor activity of 98 hand-raised, wild-derived individuals. We found, unexpectedly, that the free-running period of this diurnal species was significantly shorter than 24 h in constant dim light. We furthermore demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time in a wild vertebrate, ample genetic variation and high heritability (h2 = 0.86+0.24), implying that period length is potentially malleable by micro-evolutionary change. The observed, short period length may be a consequence of sexual selection, as offspring from extra-pair matings had significantly shorter free-running periods than their half-siblings from within-pair matings. These findings position circadian clocks in the 'real world' and underscore the value of using chronobiological approaches in evolutionary ecology. Evolutionary ecologists study variation and its fitness consequences, but often have difficulties relating behavioural variation to physiological mechanisms. The findings presented here open the possibility that properties of internal, circadian clocks affect performance in traits that are relevant to fitness and sexual selection. © 2010 The Royal Society.","author":[{"family":"Helm","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Visser","given":"Marcel E"}],"citation-key":"helm2010prsbbs","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2010.0871","issue":"1698","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"page":"3335-3342","title":"Heritable circadian period length in a wild bird population","type":"article-journal","volume":"277"},

Here we examined the relationship between δD in feathers and growing season precipitation for neotropical migrant songbirds breeding over a continent-wide isotopic gradient. δD values were determined on feathers of 140 individuals of 6 species of wild insectivorous forest songbirds (Setophaga ruticilla, Empidonax minimus, Vermivora peregrinus, Catharus ustulatus, Seiurus aurocapillus, Hylocichla mustelina) taken from 14 breeding locations across North America. The δD of feathers was strongly correlated with the δD of growing season precipitation at breeding sites across North America. As feather hydrogen is metabolically inert after growth, this relationship was then used to assess the breeding origins of wintering migrants. Deuterium values of feathers from 64 individuals representing 5 species of migrants (Helmitheros vermivorus, Wilsonia citrina, Hylocichla mustelina, Dumetella carolinensis, Seirus aurocapillus) at a wintering site in Guatemala were consistent with those predicted from the known breeding ranges of these species.

  {"id":"holton2021ptrsb","abstract":"Animal-borne tags (biologgers) have now become extremely sophisticated, recording data from multiple sensors at high frequencies for long periods and, as such, have become a powerful tool for behavioural ecologists and physiologists studying wild animals. But the design and implementation of these tags is not trivial because engineers have to maximize performance and ability to function under onerous conditions while minimizing tag mass and volume (footprint) to maximize the wellbeing of the animal carriers. We present some of the major issues faced by tag engineers and show how tag designers must accept compromises while maintaining systems that can answer the questions being posed. We also argue that basic understanding of engineering issues in tag design by biologists will help feedback to engineers to better tag construction but also reduce the likelihood that tag-deploying biologists will misunderstand their own results. Finally, we suggest that proper consideration of conventional technology together with new approaches will lead to further step changes in our understanding of wild-animal biology using smart tags.\n            This article is part of the theme issue ‘Measuring physiology in free-living animals (Part II)’.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Holton","given":"Mark D."},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Rory P."},{"family":"Teilmann","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Siebert","given":"Ursula"}],"citation-key":"holton2021ptrsb","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Phil.

The measurements are used to build a low-cost, low-complexity vehicle tracking sensor platform for highway traffic monitoring. First, the problem is formulated by introducing the process model for the motion of the vehicle on the road and two measurement models: one for each of the sensors. Second, it is shown how the measurements of the sensors can be fused using particle filtering. The standard sampling importance resampling (SIR) particle filter is extended for processing of multirate sensor measurements and models that employ unknown static parameters. The latter are treated by Rao-Blackwellization. The performance of the method is demonstrated by computer simulations. It is found that it is feasible to fuse the two sensors for vehicle tracking and that the proposed multirate particle filter performs better than particle filters that process only measurements of one of the sensors.

When the absorption of the Chappuis band of ozone in the visible spectrum was added to the Rayleigh theory, the calculated sky brightness came into agreement with observation for solar depression angles below the horizon from about 0° to 6°. For the sun below 7° the calculated zenith sky brightness fell rapidly below the observed brightness, showing that primary scattering in the atmosphere above about 60 km does not contribute appreciably to the brightness, as has long been known ( J. Opt. Soc. Am.28, 227, 1938).Calculation showed that during the day the clear sky is blue according to Rayleigh, and that ozone has little effect on the color of the daylight sky. But near sunset and throughout twilight ozone affects the sky color profoundly. For example, in the absence of ozone the zenith sky would be a grayish green-blue at sunset becoming yellowish in twilight, but with ozone the zenith sky is blue at sunset and throughout twilight (as is observed), the blue at sunset being due about 13 to Rayleigh and 23 to ozone, and during twilight wholly to ozone.","author":[{"family":"Hulburt","given":"E O"}],"citation-key":"hulburt1953josa","container-title":"Journal of the Optical Society of America","DOI":"10.1364/JOSA.43.000113","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1953]]},"page":"113-118","publisher":"OSA","title":"Explanation of the Brightness and Color of the Sky, Particularly the Twilight Sky","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josa-43-2-113","volume":"43"},

This algorithm is tested in two simulations with world magnetic model, results show that the destinations are reached effectively, which has implied potential for experiment realization in the future.","author":[{"family":"Jiang","given":"L"},{"family":"Ran","given":"L"}],"citation-key":"jiang20112icecci","container-title":"2011 International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Control (ICECC)","DOI":"10.1109/ICECC.2011.6066720","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"page":"971-974","title":"Pure geomagnetic homing navigation on earth surface","type":"paper-conference"},

With increasing attention, a new market segment has opened up for highly efﬁcient drones. However, the deployment of efﬁcient drones requires an in-depth analysis of several components spanning from hardware sensors to software stack. Speciﬁcally, to achieve high reliability, safety, and performance, the top concerns in the professional drone industry are characterizing underlying architecture and ﬂight stack. In this paper, we characterize a widely-used open source ﬂight stack, ArduCopter, to understand the performance requirements as a research community.

Our characterizations and benchmarks indicate that the drone ﬂying range can be dramatically increased by optimizing the underlying ﬂight controller software.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Jijina","given":"Sam"},{"family":"Amyette","given":"Adriana"},{"family":"Shoghi","given":"Nima"},{"family":"Hadidi","given":"Ramyad"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Hyesoon"}],"citation-key":"jijina20202iispassi","container-title":"2020 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software (ISPASS)","DOI":"10.1109/ISPASS48437.2020.00036","event":"2020 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software (ISPASS)","event-place":"Boston, MA, USA","ISBN":"978-1-72814-798-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,8]]},"language":"en","page":"212-214","publisher":"IEEE","publisher-place":"Boston, MA, USA","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Understanding the Software and Hardware Stacks of a General-Purpose Cognitive Drone","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9238616/"},
  {"id":"jonsen2013dsrpitsio","abstract":"Ecologists have an unprecedented array of bio-logging technologies available to conduct in situ studies of horizontal and vertical movement patterns of marine animals. These tracking data provide key information about foraging, migratory, and other behaviours that can be linked with bio-physical datasets to understand physiological and ecological influences on habitat selection. In most cases, however, the behavioural context is not directly observable and therefore, must be inferred. Animal movement data are complex in structure, entailing a need for stochastic analysis methods. The recent development of state-space modelling approaches for animal movement data provides statistical rigor for inferring hidden behavioural states, relating these states to bio-physical data, and ultimately for predicting the potential impacts of climate change. Despite the widespread utility, and current popularity, of state-space models for analysis of animal tracking data, these tools are not simple and require considerable care in their use. Here we develop a methodological “road map” for ecologists by reviewing currently available state-space implementations. We discuss appropriate use of state-space methods for location and/or behavioural state estimation from different tracking data types. Finally, we outline key areas where the methodology is advancing, and where it needs further development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Jonsen","given":"I.

However, challenges remain for successful deployment and interpretation of data from captive and wild animals. Accelerometer sensors require being packaged in an archival tag that has a firm attachment in a fixed (known) orientation to accurately measure the relevant motion of the animal. This requirement can lead to handling stress and attachment techniques that can affect the tagged animal’s natural behavior and welfare, and lead to behavioral artifacts in the data. Accelerometer data also require careful interpretation to correctly identify behavioral events of interest such as foraging. For endothermic species, changes in stomach temperature can produce temperature signatures indicative of foraging events.

  {"id":"karam2020iaprssis","abstract":"<p><strong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\">Abstract.</strong> In recent years, the importance of indoor mapping increased in a wide range of applications, such as facility management and mapping hazardous sites. The essential technique behind indoor mapping is simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) because SLAM offers suitable positioning estimates in environments where satellite positioning is not available. State-of-the-art indoor mobile mapping systems employ Visual-based SLAM or LiDAR-based SLAM. However, Visual-based SLAM is sensitive to textureless environments and, similarly, LiDAR-based SLAM is sensitive to a number of pose configurations where the geometry of laser observations is not strong enough to reliably estimate the six-degree-of-freedom (6DOF) pose of the system. In this paper, we present different strategies that utilize the benefits of the inertial measurement unit (IMU) in the pose estimation and support LiDAR-based SLAM in overcoming these problems. The proposed strategies have been implemented and tested using different datasets and our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods do indeed overcome these problems. We conclude that IMU observations increase the robustness of SLAM, which is expected, but also that the best reconstruction accuracy is obtained not with a blind use of all observations but by filtering the measurements with a proposed reliability measure. To this end, our results show promising improvements in reconstruction accuracy.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Karam","given":"S."},{"family":"Lehtola","given":"V."},{"family":"Vosselman","given":"G."}],"citation-key":"karam2020iaprssis","container-title":"ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences","DOI":"10.5194/isprs-annals-V-1-2020-223-2020","event":"XXIV ISPRS Congress, Commission I (Volume V-1-2020) - 2020 edition","ISSN":"2194-9042","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,3]]},"language":"English","page":"223-230","publisher":"Copernicus GmbH","source":"www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net","title":"STRATEGIES TO INTEGRATE IMU AND LIDAR SLAM FOR INDOOR MAPPING","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/V-1-2020/223/2020/","volume":"V-1-2020"},
  {"id":"katzner2020fee","abstract":"The use of animal-born sensors for location-based tracking and bio-logging in terrestrial systems has expanded dramatically in the past 10 years. This rapid expansion has generated new data on how animals interact with and respond to variation in their environment, resulting in important ecological, physiological and evolutionary insights. However, although understanding the finer details of animal locations and state also has important management relevance, applied studies are not prominent in the movement ecology literature. This is despite the long history of applied studies of animal movement and the urgent and growing need for evidence-based conservation guidance, especially in the challenging field of human-wildlife interactions. The goal of this review is to evaluate the realized contribution of tracking-based animal movement ecology to solving specific conservation problems and to identify barriers that may hinder expansion of that contribution. To do this, we (a) briefly review the history and technologies used in animal tracking and bio-logging, (b) use a series of literature searches to evaluate the frequency with which movement ecology studies are designed to solve specific conservation problems, and (c) use this information to identify challenges that limit the applied relevance of the field of movement ecology and to propose pathways to expand that applied relevance. Our literature review quantifies the limited extent to which research in the field of movement ecology is designed to solve specific conservation problems, but also the fact that such studies are slowly becoming more prevalent. We discuss how barriers that limit application of these principles are likely due to constraints imposed by the types of data used commonly in the field. For example, problems of scale mismatch, error compounding, and data paucity all create challenges that are especially pertinent in applied situations. Finding solutions to these problems will create new opportunity for movement ecologists to contribute to conservation science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Katzner","given":"Todd E."},{"family":"Arlettaz","given":"Raphaël"}],"citation-key":"katzner2020fee","container-title":"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"ketterson1976e","abstract":"The sex ratio of Dark-eyed Juncos wintering in the eastern and central United States and Canada varies clinally along a latitudinal gradient. The percentage of @V @V among both museum skins and live-caught birds is @?70% in the south, 20% in the north. When abundance according to latitude is also considered, an average @V appears to winter farther south than an average @M and hence probably tends to migrate farther. Latitude alone is an excellent predictor of sex ratio (r^2 = 85%), and latitude plus 13 other measures of climate explain virtually all the variation (r^2 = 96.6%). Extreme measures of climate, as compared to mean measures, are equally predictive. Principal component analysis indicates that snowfall, temperature, and latitude are the most important climatic variables associated with sex ratio. Because @M @M average larger than @V @V and are concentrated northward, mean wing length increases with latitude and is significantly correlated with climatic measures that vary with latitude. Further, larger birds within each sex may select higher altitudes as wintering sites. Sex ratio does not vary measurably with date in wintering populations. Among possible explanations for clinal variation in sex ratio are sex-associated differences in (1) advantages of early arrival on the breeding or wintering grounds, (2) impacts of inter- and intrasexual competition, and (3) effects of low temperature and intermittent food availability. Comparison of @M @M and @V @V with respect to potential fasting endurance, a size-related metabolic parameter, indicates that at 0 degrees C an average @M should be able to fast 4% longer (1.6 h) than an average @V at standard metabolic rates. An extremely heavy @M might endured fasting up to 29% (10.7 h) longer than a very light @V. These differences may confer greater survival ability upon the @M at latitudes where snow cover can often preclude feeding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Ketterson","given":"Ellen D."},{"family":"Nolan","given":"Val"}],"citation-key":"ketterson1976e","container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"10.2307/1936182","ISSN":"0012-9658","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1976]]},"page":"679-693","publisher":"Ecological Society of America","source":"JSTOR","title":"Geographic Variation and Its Climatic Correlates in the Sex Ratio of Eastern-Wintering Dark-Eyed Juncos (Junco Hyemalis Hyemalis)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1936182","volume":"57"},

  {"id":"kimmitt2018ee","abstract":"Animal migration can lead to a population distribution known as seasonal sympatry, in which closely-related migrant and resident populations of the same species co-occur in sympatry during part of the year, but are otherwise allopatric. During seasonal sympatry in early spring, residents may initiate reproduction before migrants depart, presenting an opportunity for gene flow. Differences in reproductive timing between migrant and resident populations may favor residents that exhibit preferences for potential mates of similar migratory behavior and reproductive timing, thus maintaining population divergence. We studied dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis), a songbird that exhibits seasonal sympatry. We conducted simulated courtship interactions in which we presented free-living resident males with either a caged migrant or resident female and quantified courtship behavior prior to the departure of the migrants. We found that resident males preferred to court resident females: they sang more short-range songs and exhibited more visual displays associated with courtship when presented with resident females. We conclude that males distinguish between migrant and resident females during seasonal sympatry when the risk of interacting with non-reproductive, migrant females is high. Male mate choice in seasonal sympatry is likely adaptive for male reproductive success. As a secondary effect, male mating preference could act to maintain or promote divergence between populations that differ in migratory strategy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Kimmitt","given":"Abigail A."},{"family":"Dietz","given":"Samantha L."},{"family":"Reichard","given":"Dustin G."},{"family":"Ketterson","given":"Ellen D."}],"citation-key":"kimmitt2018ee","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.4640","ISSN":"2045-7758","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ece3.4640","page":"11833-11841","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Male courtship preference during seasonal sympatry may maintain population divergence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.4640","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"kirbyKeyConservationIssues2008","abstract":"An estimated 19% of the world's 9,856 extant bird species are migratory, including some 1,600 species of land- and waterbirds. In 2008, 11% of migratory land- and waterbirds were classed by BirdLife International as threatened or near-threatened on the IUCN Red List. Red List indices show that these migrants have become more threatened since 1988, with 33 species deteriorating and just six improving in status. There is also increasing evidence of regional declines. Population trend data show that more Nearctic–Neotropical migrants have declined than increased in North America since the 1980s, and more Palearctic–Afrotropical migrants breeding in Europe declined than increased during 1970–2000. Reviews of the status of migratory raptors show unfavourable conservation status for 51% of species in the African–Eurasian region (in 2005), and 33% of species in Central, South and East Asia (in 2007). Land-use change owing to agriculture is the most frequently cited threat affecting nearly 80% of all threatened and near-threatened species. However, while agricultural intensification on the breeding grounds is often proposed as the major driver of declines in Palearctic–Afrotropical migrants, some species appear to be limited by the quantity and quality of available habitat in non-breeding areas, notably the drylands of tropical Africa. Forest fragmentation in breeding areas has contributed to the declines of Nearctic–Neotropical migrants with deforestation in non-breeding areas another possible factor. Infrastructure development including wind turbines, cables, towers and masts can also be a threat. Over-harvesting and persecution remain serious threats, particularly at key migration locations. Climate change is affecting birds already, is expected to exacerbate all these pressures, and may also increase competition between migratory and non-migratory species. The conservation of migratory birds thus requires a multitude of approaches. Many migratory birds require effective management of their critical sites, and Important Bird Areas (IBAs) provide an important foundation for such action; however to function effectively in conserving migratory species, IBAs need to be protected and the coherence of the network requires regular review. Since many migratory species (c. 55%) are widely dispersed across their breeding or non-breeding ranges, it is essential to address the human-induced changes at the wider landscape scale, a very considerable challenge. Efforts to conserve migratory birds in one part of the range are less effective if unaddressed threats are reducing these species' populations and habitats elsewhere.

Hybridization is predicted to be more common when environmental conditions change rapidly. Here, we test patterns of hybridization in three sympatric tree finch species (small tree finch Camarhynchus parvulus, medium tree finch Camarhynchus pauper, and large tree finch: Camarhynchus psittacula) that are currently recognized on Floreana Island, Galápagos Archipelago. Genetic analysis of microsatellite data from contemporary samples showed two genetic populations and one hybrid cluster in both 2005 and 2010; hybrid individuals were derived from genetic population 1 (small morph) and genetic population 2 (large morph). Females of the large and rare species were more likely to pair with males of the small common species. Finch populations differed in morphology in 1852- 1906 compared with 2005/2010. An unsupervised clustering method showed (a) support for three morphological clusters in the historical tree finch sample (1852-1906), which is consistent with current species recognition; (b) support for two or three morphological clusters in 2005 with some (19%) hybridization; and (c) support for just two morphological clusters in 2010 with frequent (41%) hybridization.

In order to obtain accurate orientation estimates it is imperative that the magnetometer and inertial sensor axes are aligned and that the magnetometer is properly calibrated for both sensor errors as well as presence of magnetic distortions. In this work we derive an easy-to-use calibration algorithm that can be used to calibrate a combination of a magnetometer and inertial sensors. The algorithm compensates for any static magnetic distortions created by the sensor platform, magnetometer sensor errors and determines the alignment between the magnetometer and the inertial sensor axes. The resulting calibration procedure does not require any additional hardware. We make use of probabilistic models and obtain the calibration algorithm as the solution to a maximum likelihood problem. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is illustrated using experimental data collected from a sensor unit placed in a magnetically disturbed environment onboard a jet aircraft.","author":[{"family":"Kok","given":"M"},{"family":"Hol","given":"J D"},{"family":"Schön","given":"T B"},{"family":"Gustafsson","given":"F"},{"family":"Luinge","given":"H"}],"citation-key":"kok201221icif","container-title":"2012 15th International Conference on Information Fusion","ISBN":"VO -","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"page":"787-793","title":"Calibration of a magnetometer in combination with inertial sensors","type":"paper-conference"},

Inertial sensor measurements are obtained at high sampling rates and can be integrated to obtain position and orientation information.

To overcome this issue, inertial sensors are typically combined with additional sensors and models. In this tutorial we focus on the signal processing aspects of position and orientation estimation using inertial sensors. We discuss different modeling choices and a selected number of important algorithms.

Whereas the specific mechanisms driving seasonal changes in reproductive function vary across species, converging lines of evidence suggest gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH) serves as a key component of the neuroendocrine circuitry driving seasonal changes in reproduction and sexual motivation in some species. In addition to anticipating environmental change through transduction of photoperiodic information and modifying reproductive state accordingly, GnIH is also positioned to regulate acute changes in reproductive status should unpredictable conditions manifest throughout the year.

  {"id":"lam2008fr","abstract":"Tracking marine animals with electronic tags has become an indispensable tool in understanding biology in relation to movement. Combining light based geolocation estimates with an underlying movement model has proved helpful in reconstructing the most probable track of tagged animals. These tracks can be further improved by including the tag measured sea-surface temperature and matching it to external sea-surface temperature (SST) data. The current methodology for doing this in a state-space model requires that external sea-surface temperature be smoothed before it is used in the model, and further that its gradient field is pre-calculated. This two-step approach has a number of technical drawbacks, and the final statistical inference about the most probable track is consequently less convincing. This paper presents a new methodology (refer to as UKFSST) where all steps, including the SST smoothing, are handled within one coherent model. An additional benefit is that even the degree of smoothing, which was previously pre-determined and fixed, can now be optimally selected. UKFSST offers better handling of non-linearities in Kalman filter, and provides a statistically sound model for geolocation applications, as opposed to ad hoc SST matching approaches. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

  {"id":"lameris2018ab","abstract":"Background: Tracking devices have enabled researchers to study unique aspects of behavior in birds. However, it has become clear that attaching these devices to birds often affects their survival and behavior. While most studies only focus on negative effects on return rates, tracking devices can also affect the behavior under study, and it is therefore important to measure potential negative effects of tracking device attachment on the full range of behavioral aspects of birds. At the same time, we should aim to improve our current attachment methods to reduce these effects. Results: We used a modified harness to attach tracking devices to a total of 111 individuals of three goose species (Greater White-fronted Geese, Brent Geese, and Barnacle Geese) to study their migratory behavior. By creating control groups of birds marked with colored leg bands, geolocators, and/or neck collars, we were able to compare return rates, body condition, and migratory and reproductive behavior, thus allowing a much broader comparison than return rates alone. Birds with harness-attached tracking devices had lower return rates, which could partly be explained by increased rates of divorce, but is likely also the result of reduced survival induced by the harness and device. A comparison between Barnacle Geese equipped with harness-attached tracking devices and individuals fitted with geolocators attached to leg bands showed that birds equipped with tracking devices were only slightly delayed in timing of migration and reproduction and otherwise were not affected in reproductive output. Conclusions: We argue that tracking devices can be used for studies on migration timing. Nevertheless, given the effect of tracking devices on survival and divorce rate, which may differ between sexes and species, we stress that researchers should carefully consider which birds to tag in order to reduce potential negative effects.","author":[{"family":"Lameris","given":"Thomas K"},{"family":"Müskens","given":"Gerhard J.D.M."},{"family":"Kölzsch","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Dokter","given":"Adriaan M."},{"family":"Van der Jeugd","given":"Henk P."},{"family":"Nolet","given":"Bart A."}],"citation-key":"lameris2018ab","container-title":"Animal Biotelemetry","DOI":"10.1186/s40317-018-0153-3","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"title":"Effects of harness-attached tracking devices on survival, migration, and reproduction in three species of migratory waterfowl","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},

However, little empirical evidence has been provided to validate whether they produce similar results. We compared activity curves from two common camera trapping techniques to those from radiotags with four species that varied substantially in size (~1 kg–~50 kg), diet (herbivore, omnivore, carnivore), and mode of activity (diurnal and crepuscular). Also, we sub-sampled photographs of each species with each camera trapping technique to determine the minimum sample size needed to maintain accuracy and precision of estimates. Camera trapping estimated greater activity during feeding times than radiotags in all but the carnivore, likely reflective of the close proximity of foods readily consumed by all species except the carnivore (i.e., corn bait or acorns). However, additional analyses still indicated both camera trapping methods produced relatively high overlap and correlation to radiotags. Regardless of species or camera trapping method, mean overlap increased and overlap error decreased rapidly as sample sizes increased until an asymptote near 100 detections which we therefore recommend as a minimum sample size. Researchers should acknowledge that camera traps and radiotags may estimate the same mode of activity but differ in their estimation of magnitude in activity peaks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Lashley","given":"Marcus A."},{"family":"Cove","given":"Michael V."},{"family":"Chitwood","given":"M.

This is due to the fact that the charged particles that comprise space plasma can move almost freely along magnetic field lines, but not across them. For this reason it is sensible to present such phenomena relative to Earth’s magnetic field. A large variety of magnetic coordinate systems exist, designed for different purposes and regions, ranging from the magnetopause to the ionosphere. In this paper we review the most common magnetic coordinate systems and describe how they are defined, where they are used, and how to convert between them. The definitions are presented based on the spherical harmonic expansion coefficients of the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) and, in some of the coordinate systems, the position of the Sun which we show how to calculate from the time and date. The most detailed coordinate systems take the full IGRF into account and define magnetic latitude and longitude such that they are constant along field lines. These coordinate systems, which are useful at ionospheric altitudes, are non-orthogonal. We show how to handle vectors and vector calculus in such coordinates, and discuss how systematic errors may appear if this is not done correctly.","author":[{"family":"Laundal","given":"K M"},{"family":"Richmond","given":"A D"}],"citation-key":"laundal2017ssr","container-title":"Space Science Reviews","DOI":"10.1007/s11214-016-0275-y","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"page":"27-59","title":"Magnetic Coordinate Systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11214-016-0275-y","volume":"206"},

  {"id":"lee2020n","abstract":"Abstract Instances of spoofing and jamming of global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) have emphasized the need for alternative navigation methods. Aerial navigation by magnetic map matching has been demonstrated as a viable GNSS-alternative navigation technique. Flight test demonstrations have achieved accuracies of tens of meters over hour-long flights, but these flights required accurate magnetic maps which are not always available. Magnetic map availability and resolution vary widely around the globe. Removing the dependency on prior survey maps extends the benefits of aerial magnetic navigation methods to small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) at lower altitudes where magnetic maps are especially undersampled or unavailable. In this paper, a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm known as FastSLAM was modified to use scalar magnetic measurements to constrain a drifting inertial navigation system (INS). The algorithm was then demonstrated on real magnetic navigation flight test data. Similar in performance to the map-based approach, MagSLAM achieved tens of meters accuracy in a 100-minute flight without the use of a prior magnetic map. Aerial SLAM using Earth's magnetic anomaly field provides a GNSS-alternative navigation method that is globally persistent, impervious to jamming or spoofing, stealthy, and locally accurate to tens of meters without the need for a magnetic map.","author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Taylor N"},{"family":"Canciani","given":"Aaron J"}],"citation-key":"lee2020n","container-title":"NAVIGATION","DOI":"10.1002/navi.352","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3]]},"page":"95-107","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","title":"MagSLAM: Aerial simultaneous localization and mapping using Earth's magnetic anomaly field","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1002/navi.352","volume":"67"},

  {"id":"leos-barajas2017mee","abstract":"Use of accelerometers is now widespread within animal biologging as they provide a means of measuring an animal's activity in a meaningful and quantitative way where direct observation is not possible. In sequential acceleration data, there is a natural dependence between observations of behaviour, a fact that has been largely ignored in most analyses. Analyses of acceleration data where serial dependence has been explicitly modelled have largely relied on hidden Markov models (HMMs). Depending on the aim of an analysis, an HMM can be used for state prediction or to make inferences about drivers of behaviour. For state prediction, a supervised learning approach can be applied. That is, an HMM is trained to classify unlabelled acceleration data into a finite set of pre-specified categories. An unsupervised learning approach can be used to infer new aspects of animal behaviour when biologically meaningful response variables are used, with the caveat that the states may not map to specific behaviours. We provide the details necessary to implement and assess an HMM in both the supervised and unsupervised learning context and discuss the data requirements of each case. We outline two applications to marine and aerial systems (shark and eagle) taking the unsupervised learning approach, which is more readily applicable to animal activity measured in the field. HMMs were used to infer the effects of temporal, atmospheric and tidal inputs on animal behaviour. Animal accelerometer data allow ecologists to identify important correlates and drivers of animal activity (and hence behaviour). The HMM framework is well suited to deal with the main features commonly observed in accelerometer data and can easily be extended to suit a wide range of types of animal activity data. The ability to combine direct observations of animal activity with statistical models, which account for the features of accelerometer data, offers a new way to quantify animal behaviour and energetic expenditure and to deepen our insights into individual behaviour as a constituent of populations and ecosystems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Leos‐Barajas","given":"Vianey"},{"family":"Photopoulou","given":"Theoni"},{"family":"Langrock","given":"Roland"},{"family":"Patterson","given":"Toby A."},{"family":"Watanabe","given":"Yuuki Y."},{"family":"Murgatroyd","given":"Megan"},{"family":"Papastamatiou","given":"Yannis P."}],"citation-key":"leos-barajas2017mee","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12657","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/2041-210X.12657","page":"161-173","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Analysis of animal accelerometer data using hidden Markov models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.12657","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"li20142dissi","abstract":"Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) based on LIDAR and MEMS IMU is a kind of autonomous integrated navigation technology. It can provide attitude, velocity position for a small UAV in an indoor frame during the outage of GNSS. A method of integrating the measurements from a LIDAR and a MEMS IMU was proposed in the paper. LIDAR measurements are a set of ranges and scan angles. The angle rates and accelerations from MEMS IMU are used to drive the simplified strapdown INS equations. The first step of the method is environment features extracting from the measurements of LIDAR and constructing a feature map. Then, the model of errors of LIDAR measurement due to the change of the scan plane during the attitude manoeuver is established and compensated based on aiding information from MEMS INS and the assumption about the structural indoor environment.

  {"id":"li2017fn","abstract":"This paper presents a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm of bio-inspired geomagnetic navigation for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). Inspired by the biological navigation behavior, the solution was proposed without using a priori information, simply by magnetotaxis searching. However, the existence of the geomagnetic anomalies has significant influence on the geomagnetic navigation system, which often disrupts the distribution of the geomagnetic field. An extreme value region may easily appear in abnormal regions, which makes AUV lost in the navigation phase. This paper proposes an improved bio-inspired algorithm with behavior constraints, for sake of making AUV escape from the abnormal region. First, the navigation problem is considered as the optimization problem. Second, the environmental monitoring operator is introduced, to determine whether the algorithm falls into the geomagnetic anomaly region. Then, the behavior constraint operator is employed to get out of the abnormal region. Finally, the termination condition is triggered. Compared to the state-of- the-art, the proposed approach effectively overcomes the disturbance of the geomagnetic abnormal. The simulation result demonstrates the reliability and feasibility of the proposed approach in complex environments.","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Hong"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Mingyong"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Feihu"}],"citation-key":"li2017fn","container-title":"Frontiers in Neurorobotics","ISSN":"1662-5218","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"page":"34-34","title":"Geomagnetic Navigation of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Based on Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnbot.2017.00034","volume":"11"},

Birds migrating or foraging while airborne are thought to spend some time resting on the ground or water to recover from these energetically demanding activities. However, for several decades ornithologists have claimed that some swifts may stay airborne for almost their whole lifetime. Here we present the first unequivocal evidence that an individual bird of the Alpine swift (Tachymarptis melba) can stay airborne for migration, foraging and roosting over a period of more than 6 months. To date, such long-lasting locomotive activities had been reported only for animals living in the sea. Even for an aerodynamically optimized bird, like the Alpine swift, flying requires a considerable amount of energy for continuous locomotive control.

In their seasonal migrations between Sweden and sub-Saharan Africa, great snipes Gallinago media make non-stop flights of 4,000–7,000 km, lasting 60–90 h.9,10 Activity and air pressure data from multisensor dataloggers showed that great snipes repeatedly changed altitudes around dawn and dusk, between average cruising heights about 2,000 m (above sea level) at night and around 4,000 m during daytime. Frequency and autocorrelation analyses corroborated a conspicuous diel cycle in flight altitude. Most birds regularly flew at 6,000 m and one bird reached 8,700 m, possibly the highest altitude ever recorded for an identified migrating bird. The diel altitude changes took place independently of climate zone, topography, and habitat overflown. Ambient temperature, wind condition, and humidity have no important diel variation at the high altitudes chosen by great snipes. Instead, improved view for orientation by landmarks, predator avoidance, and not least, seeking cold altitudes at day to counteract heating from direct sunlight are the most plausible explanations for the diel altitude cycle. Together with similar recent findings for a small songbird,6 the great snipes’ altitudinal performance sheds new light on the complexity and challenges of migratory flights.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Lindström","given":"Åke"},{"family":"Alerstam","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Andersson","given":"Arne"},{"family":"Bäckman","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Bahlenberg","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Bom","given":"Roeland"},{"family":"Ekblom","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Klaassen","given":"Raymond H.

  {"id":"linek2021ptrsbbs","abstract":"In a seasonal world, organisms are continuously adjusting physiological processes relative to local environmental conditions. Owing to their limited heat and fat storage capacities, small animals, such as songbirds, must rapidly modulate their metabolism in response to weather extremes and changing seasons to ensure survival. As a consequence of previous technical limitations, most of our existing knowledge about how animals respond to changing environmental conditions comes from laboratory studies or field studies over short temporal scales. Here, we expanded beyond previous studies by outfitting 71 free-ranging Eurasian blackbirds (Turdus merula) with novel heart rate and body temperature loggers coupled with radio transmitters, and followed individuals in the wild from autumn to spring. Across seasons, blackbirds thermoconformed at night, i.e. their body temperature decreased with decreasing ambient temperature, but not so during daytime. By contrast, during all seasons blackbirds increased their heart rate when ambient temperatures became colder. However, the temperature setpoint at which heart rate was increased differed between seasons and between day and night. In our study, blackbirds showed an overall seasonal reduction in mean heart rate of 108 beats min−1 (21%) as well as a 1.2°C decrease in nighttime body temperature. Episodes of hypometabolism during cold periods likely allow the birds to save energy and, thus, help offset the increased energetic costs during the winter when also confronted with lower resource availability. Our data highlight that, similar to larger non-hibernating mammals and birds, small passerine birds such as Eurasian blackbirds not only adjust their heart rate and body temperature on daily timescales, but also exhibit pronounced seasonal changes in both that are modulated by local environmental conditions such as temperature.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Measuring physiology in free-living animals (Part I)’.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Linek","given":"Nils"},{"family":"Volkmer","given":"Tamara"},{"family":"Shipley","given":"J.

  {"id":"lisovski2018","abstract":"Solar geolocation has become one of the most frequently used tools in wader migration research. Geolocators provide location estimates based on recorded light intensities, and more specifically, on the changes in light during the twilight periods, allowing an increase in knowledge on how waders migrate across the globe. Yet, quite a number of species breed in polar regions where they experience 24-hour daylight. Given the lack of recorded twilight times on the geolocators during this period, analysis methods have been unable to resolve birds’ positions when they are in constant daylight. This is especially problematic in the older geolocator generations that could record light only over a narrow range of light intensities. Some newer geolocators record the full light range, allowing even small changes in light intensity during the day (under bright light conditions) to be detected. However, the common methods for estimating locations are not designed for changes in high light regimes that lack dark periods during the night. Previously, I developed and implemented a method for analysing continuous light records, which evaluates the likelihood of a measured light cycle being from a given location, leading to first estimates of breeding sites in Sanderlings Calidris alba and Great Knots C. tenuirostris. However, the final decision on the breeding site was somewhat subjective and a formal description of the method was still lacking.

From light-level geolocator data, wherein geographical locations are estimated via the timing of sunrise and sunset, Streby et al.

  {"id":"lisovskiGeolocationLightAccuracy2012","abstract":"ABSTRACT. \n Determining the distribution of stopover and overwintering areas of migratory animals is essential for understanding population dynamics and building predictive models. Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) are small songbirds that breed across North America. Data from Doppler weather radar and eBird indicate that Tree Swallow numbers increase throughout October and November in southeastern Louisiana, but then decrease during December. We thus hypothesized that southeastern Louisiana is a stopover area used by Tree Swallows during fall migration before they move to farther overwintering areas. We tested this hypothesis by attaching light-logging geolocators to Tree Swallows at five breeding sites spanning the species&#39; breeding range from British Columbia to Nova Scotia, and then tracking their fall migration routes, stopover sites, and wintering locations. Of 38 individuals that returned in the following breeding season, 11 birds from three breeding sites (Saskatchewan, Wisconsin, and Ontario) used southeastern Louisiana as a stopover site. Arrival date and duration of stay closely matched observations from both eBird and radar data. From Louisiana, most Tree Swallows continued their migration to one of three wintering sites: peninsular Florida, the Bahamas, or the Yucatán Peninsula, whereas two birds remained until spring within 200 km of the stopover area. Our results (1) suggest that southeastern Louisiana is an extended stopover site for Tree Swallows that originate from a wide geographic range on the breeding grounds; and (2) demonstrate how geolocators, combined with other sources of movement information, reveal habitat use throughout the annual cycle.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Lisovski","given":"S."},{"family":"Hewson","given":"C."},{"family":"Klaassen","given":"R."},{"family":"Korner-Nievergelt","given":"F."},{"family":"Kristensen","given":"M.

  {"id":"liu2007jgrse","abstract":"The normal Morlet wavelet transform (NMWT), which is a mathematical method for harmonic analysis, is defined in this study by resorting to L1 normalization continuous wavelet transform and a normalized simplified Morlet wavelet. The NMWT of a complex time signal enables direct recognition and extraction of the harmonic components of the signal without an inverse transform. We demonstrate theoretically and numerically the benefit of the NMWT in the harmonic analysis. A NMWT analysis of the observed polar motion data shows that except for the prograde annual wobble (PAW), the interseasonal wobbles including the retrograde annual wobble (RAW) became less significant in amplitude by at least 70% after the 1970s, manifesting the accuracy improvement in the polar motion observation. This NMWT analysis proves that the observed Chandler wobble possesses only one instantaneous period at any time point within the 20th century and such instantaneous period is slightly variable around 433.08 days with a standard deviation of 1.57 days from 1950 to 2000. Using the NMWT analysis, we show that at the prograde and retrograde annual scales, the atmospheric pressure and the oceanic current play the most significant and stable role in polar motion excitation. The atmosphere and ocean can explain the phases of the PAW with 15 days discrepancy but only 70% of the amplitude of the PAW. However, they can explain the RAW with less than 10 days in phase discrepancy and less than 10% in amplitude discrepancy. This study reveals that the ocean always reduces the atmospheric effects on the annual polar motion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Lintao"},{"family":"Hsu","given":"Houtse"},{"family":"Grafarend","given":"Erik W."}],"citation-key":"liu2007jgrse","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/2006JB004895","ISSN":"2156-2202","issue":"B8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2006JB004895","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Normal Morlet wavelet transform and its application to the Earth's polar motion","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2006JB004895","volume":"112"},

In this paper, we report a novel analytic attitude solution to the accelerometer-magnetometer combination in the sense of Wahba’s problem.

Then, the corresponding eigenvectors are given accordingly via matrix row operations. The system is highly optimized based on the factorization and simplification of the obtained row-echelon form, which makes it computationally fast in practice. In this way, it is named as the fast accelerometer-magnetometer combination (FAMC). Experiments on the correctness and advantages of the proposed solution are conducted. The results show that compared with conventional solutions, the proposed analytic solution is not only correct and accurate, but to our knowledge, the most time efficient as well.","author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Zhuohua"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Gong","given":"Xiangyang"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Jin"}],"citation-key":"liu2018js","container-title":"Journal of Sensors","DOI":"10.1155/2018/8787236","editor":[{"family":"Dell'Olio","given":"Francesco"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"page":"8787236-8787236","publisher":"Hindawi","title":"Simplified Attitude Determination Algorithm Using Accelerometer and Magnetometer with Extremely Low Execution Time","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/8787236","volume":"2018"},
  {"id":"lohmann1994jeb","abstract":"For animals that migrate long distances, the magnetic field of the earth provides not only a possible cue for compass orientation, but a potential source of world-wide positional information. At each location on the globe, the geomagnetic field lines intersect the earth's surface at a specific angle of inclination. Because inclination angles vary with latitude, an animal able to distinguish between different field inclinations might, in principle, determine its approximate latitude. Such an ability, however, has never been demonstrated in any animal. We studied the magnetic orientation behavior of hatchling loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta L.) exposed to earth-strength magnetic fields of different inclinations. Hatchlings exposed to the natural field of their natal beach swam eastward, as they normally do during their offshore migration. In contrast, those subjected to an inclination angle found on the northern boundary of the North Atlantic gyre (their presumed migratory path) swam south-southwest. Hatchlings exposed to an inclination angle found near the southern boundary of the gyre swam in a northeasterly direction, and those exposed to inclination angles they do not normally encounter, or to a field inclination found well within the northern and southern extremes of the gyre, were not significantly oriented. These results demonstrate that sea turtles can distinguish between different magnetic inclination angles and perhaps derive from them an approximation of latitude. Most sea turtles nest on coastlines that are aligned approximately north­south, so that each region of nesting beach has a unique inclination angle associated with it. We therefore hypothesize that the ability to recognize specific inclination angles may largely explain how adult sea turtles can identify their natal beaches after years at sea.","author":[{"literal":"Lohmann"},{"literal":"Lohmann"}],"citation-key":"lohmann1994jeb","container-title":"The Journal of experimental biology","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1994]]},"page":"23-32","title":"Detection of Magnetic Inclination Angle by Sea Turtles: A Possible Mechanism for Determining Latitude","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9317267","volume":"194"},

  {"id":"lohmann2007jeb","abstract":"Diverse animals detect the Earth's magnetic field and use it as a cue in orientation and navigation. Most research on magnetoreception has focused on the directional or `compass' information that can be extracted from the Earth's field. Because the field varies predictably across the surface of the globe, however, it also provides a potential source of positional or `map' information, which some animals use to steer themselves along migratory pathways or to navigate toward specific target areas. The use of magnetic positional information has been demonstrated in several diverse animals including sea turtles, spiny lobsters, newts and birds, suggesting that such systems are phylogenetically widespread and can function over a wide range of spatial scales. These `magnetic maps' have not yet been fully characterized. They may be organized in several fundamentally different ways, some of which bear little resemblance to human maps, and they may also be used in conjunction with unconventional navigational strategies.","author":[{"family":"Lohmann","given":"Kenneth J"},{"family":"Lohmann","given":"Catherine M F"},{"family":"Putman","given":"Nathan F"}],"citation-key":"lohmann2007jeb","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Biology","DOI":"10.1242/jeb.001313","issue":"21","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,11]]},"page":"3697 LP-3705","title":"Magnetic maps in animals: nature's GPS","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/21/3697.abstract","volume":"210"},
  {"id":"lopez-lopez2016a","abstract":"Technological innovations have led to exciting fast-moving developments in science. Today, we are living in a technology-driven era of biological discovery. Consequently, tracking technologies have facilitated dramatic advances in the fundamental understanding of ecology and animal behaviour. Major technological improvements, such as the development of GPS dataloggers, geolocators and other bio-logging technologies, provide a volume of data that were hitherto unconceivable. Hence we can claim that ornithology has entered the era of big data. In this paper, which is particularly addressed to undergraduate students and starting researchers in the emerging field of movement ecology, I summarise the current state of the art of individual-based tracking methods for birds as well as the most important challenges that, as a personal user, I consider we should address in future. To this end, I first provide a brief overview of individual tracking systems for birds. I then discuss current challenges for tracking birds with remote telemetry, including technological challenges (i.e., tag miniaturisation, incorporation of more bio-logging sensors, better efficiency in data archiving and data processing), as well as scientific challenges (i.e., development of new computational tools, investigation of spatial and temporal autocorrelation of data, improvement in environmental data annotation processes, the need for novel behavioural segmentation algorithms, the change from two to three, and even four, dimensions in the scale of analysis, and the inclusion of animal interactions). I also highlight future prospects of this research field including a set of scientific questions that have been answered by means of telemetry technologies or are expected to be answered in the future. Finally, I discuss some ethical aspects of bird tracking, putting special emphases on getting the most out of data and enhancing a culture of multidisciplinary collaboration among research groups.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"López-López","given":"Pascual"}],"citation-key":"lopez-lopez2016a","container-title":"Ardeola","container-title-short":"arla","DOI":"10.13157/arla.63.1.2016.rp5","ISSN":"0570-7358, 2341-0825","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,6]]},"page":"103-136","publisher":"Spanish Society of Ornithology","source":"bioone.org","title":"Individual-Based Tracking Systems in Ornithology: Welcome to the Era of Big Data","title-short":"Individual-Based Tracking Systems in Ornithology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bioone.org/journals/ardeola/volume-63/issue-1/arla.63.1.2016.rp5/Individual-Based-Tracking-Systems-in-Ornithology--Welcome-to-the/10.13157/arla.63.1.2016.rp5.full","volume":"63"},

It is applicable to inertial measurement units (IMUs) consisting of tri-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers, and magnetic angular rate and gravity (MARG) sensor arrays that also include tri-axis magnetometers. The MARG implementation incorporates magnetic distortion compensation. The algorithm uses a quaternion representation, allowing accelerometer and magnetometer data to be used in an analytically derived and optimised gradient descent algorithm to compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative. Performance has been evaluated empirically using a commercially available orientation sensor and reference measurements of orientation obtained using an optical measurement system. Performance was also benchmarked against the propriety Kalman-based algorithm of orientation sensor. Results indicate the algorithm achieves levels of accuracy matching that of the Kalman based algorithm; <; 0.8° static RMS error, <; 1.7° dynamic RMS error. The implications of the low computational load and ability to operate at small sampling rates significantly reduces the hardware and power necessary for wearable inertial movement tracking, enabling the creation of lightweight, inexpensive systems capable of functioning for extended periods of time.","author":[{"family":"Madgwick","given":"S O H"},{"family":"Harrison","given":"A J L"},{"family":"Vaidyanathan","given":"R"}],"citation-key":"madgwick20112iicrr","container-title":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics","DOI":"10.1109/ICORR.2011.5975346","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"page":"1-7","title":"Estimation of IMU and MARG orientation using a gradient descent algorithm","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"mccafferty2015ab","abstract":"The thermal physiology of most birds and mammals is characterised by considerable spatial and temporal variation in body temperature. Body temperature is, therefore, a key parameter in physiological, behavioural and ecological research. Temperature measurements on freely moving or free-ranging animals in the wild are challenging but can be undertaken using a range of techniques. Internal temperature may be sampled using thermometry, surgically implanted loggers or transmitters, gastrointestinal or non-surgically placed devices. Less invasive approaches measure peripheral temperature with subcutaneous passive integrated transponder tags or skin surface-mounted radio transmitters and data loggers, or use infrared thermography to record surface temperature. Choice of technique is determined by focal research question and region of interest that reflects appropriate physiological or behavioural causal mechanisms of temperature change, as well as welfare and logistical considerations. Particularly required are further studies that provide opportunities of continuously sampling from multiple sites from within the body. This will increase our understanding of thermoregulation and temperature variation in different parts of the body and how these temperatures may change in response to physiological, behavioural and environmental parameters. Technological advances that continue to reduce the size and remote sensing capability of temperature recorders will greatly benefit field research.","author":[{"family":"McCafferty","given":"D.

  {"id":"meier2018bes","abstract":"Studying individual flight behaviour throughout the year is indispensable to understand the ecology of a bird species. Recent development in technology allows now to track flight behaviour of small long-distance bird migrants throughout its annual cycle. The specific flight behaviour of twilight ascents in birds has been documented in a few studies, but only during a short period of the year, and never quantified on the individual level. It has been suggested that twilight ascents might be a role in orientation and navigation. Previous studies had reported the behaviour only near the breeding site and during migration. We investigated year-round flight behaviour of 34 individual Alpine swifts (Apus melba) of four different populations in relation to twilight ascents. We recorded twilight ascents all around the year and found a twofold higher frequency in ascents during the non-breeding residence phase in Africa compared to all other phases of the year. Dawn ascents were twice as common as dusk ascents and occurred mainly when atmospheric conditions remained stable over a 24-h period. We found no conclusive support that twilight ascents are essential for recalibration of compass cues and landmarks. Data on the wing flapping intensity revealed that high activity at twilight occurred more regularly than the ascents. We therefore conclude that alpine swift generally increase flight activity—also horizontal flight—during the twilight period and we suppose that this increased flight activity, including ascents, might be part of social interactions between individuals.","author":[{"family":"Meier","given":"Christoph M"},{"family":"Karaardıç","given":"Hakan"},{"family":"Aymí","given":"Raül"},{"family":"Peev","given":"Strahil G"},{"family":"Bächler","given":"Erich"},{"family":"Weber","given":"Roger"},{"family":"Witvliet","given":"Willem"},{"family":"Liechti","given":"Felix"}],"citation-key":"meier2018bes","container-title":"Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology","DOI":"10.1007/s00265-017-2438-6","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"page":"45-45","title":"What makes Alpine swift ascend at twilight?

  {"id":"merkel2016me","abstract":"Background: The use of light level loggers (geolocators) to understand movements and distributions in terrestrial and marine vertebrates, particularly during the non-breeding period, has increased dramatically in recent years. However, inferring positions from light data is not straightforward, often relies on assumptions that are difficult to test, or includes an element of subjectivity. Results: We present an intuitive framework to compute locations from twilight events collected by geolocators from different manufacturers. The procedure uses an iterative forward step selection, weighting each possible position using a set of parameters that can be specifically selected for each analysis. The approach was tested on data from two wide-ranging seabird species - black-browed albatross Thalassarche melanophris and wandering albatross Diomedea exulans - tracked at Bird Island, South Georgia, during the two most contrasting periods of the year in terms of light regimes (solstice and equinox). Using additional information on travel speed, sea surface temperature and land avoidance, our approach was considerably more accurate than the traditional threshold method (errors reduced to medians of 185 km and 145 km for solstice and equinox periods, respectively). Conclusions: The algorithm computes stable results with uncertainty estimates, including around the equinoxes, and does not require calibration of solar angles. Accuracy can be increased by assimilating information on travel speed and behaviour, as well as environmental data. This framework is available through the open source R package probGLS, and can be applied in a wide range of biologging studies.","author":[{"family":"Merkel","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Richard A."},{"family":"Descamps","given":"Sébastien"},{"family":"Yoccoz","given":"Nigel G."},{"family":"Moe","given":"Børge"},{"family":"Strøm","given":"Hallvard"}],"citation-key":"merkel2016me","container-title":"Movement Ecology","DOI":"10.1186/s40462-016-0091-8","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"title":"A probabilistic algorithm to process geolocation data","type":"article-journal","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"mooney2015ab","abstract":"Background: Soft-bodied marine invertebrates comprise a keystone component of ocean ecosystems; however, we know little of their behaviors and physiological responses within their natural habitat. Quantifying ocean conditions and measuring organismal responses to the physical environment is vital to understanding the species or ecosystem-level influences of a changing ocean. Results: Here we describe a novel, soft-bodied invertebrate eco-sensor tag (the ITAG), its trial attachments to squid and jellyfish, and the fine-scale behavioral measurements recorded on captive animals. Tags were deployed on five jellyfish (Aurelia aurita) and eight squid (Loligo forbesi) in laboratory conditions for up to 24h. Using concurrent video and tag data, movement signatures for specific behaviors were identified. These behaviors included straight swimming (for jellyfish), and finning, jetting, direction reversal and turning (for squid). Overall activity levels were quantified using the root-mean-squared magnitude of acceleration, and finning was found to be the dominant squid swimming gait during captive squid experiments. External light sensors on the ITAG were used to compare squid swimming activity relative to ambient light across a ca. 20-h trial. The deployments revealed that while swimming was continuous for captive squid, energetically costly swimming behaviors (i.e., jetting and rapid direction reversals) occurred infrequently. These data reflect the usefulness of the ITAG to study trade-offs between behavior and energy expenditure in captive and wild animals. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that eco-sensors with sufficiently high sampling rates can be applied to quantify behavior of soft-bodied taxa and changes in behavior due to interactions with the surrounding environment. The methods and tool described here open the door for substantial lab and field-based measurements of fine-scale behavior, physiology, and concurrent environmental parameters that will inform fisheries management, and elucidate the ecology of these important keystone taxa.","author":[{"family":"Mooney","given":"T Aran"},{"family":"Katija","given":"Kakani"},{"family":"Shorter","given":"K Alex"},{"family":"Hurst","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Fontes","given":"Jorge"},{"family":"Afonso","given":"Pedro"}],"citation-key":"mooney2015ab","container-title":"Animal Biotelemetry","DOI":"10.1186/s40317-015-0076-1","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"title":"ITAG: An eco-sensor for fine-scale behavioral measurements of soft-bodied marine invertebrates","type":"article-journal","volume":"3"},

GPS and other technologies enable detailed tracking of animal location concurrently with acquisition of landscape data and information on individual physiology. These tools can be used to refine our understanding of the mechanistic links between behaviour and individual condition through ‘spatially informed’ movement models where time allocation to different behaviours affects individual survival and reproduction. For some species, socially informed models that address the movements and average fitness of differently sized groups and how they are affected by fission–fusion processes at relevant temporal scales are required. Furthermore, as most animals revisit some places and avoid others based on their previous experiences, we foresee the incorporation of long-term memory and intention in movement models. The way animals move has important consequences for the degree of mixing that we expect to find both within a population and between individuals of different species.

It has been clearly demonstrated that birds are able to sense the compass direction of the Earth’s magnetic field and that they can use this information as part of a compass sense. Magnetic information could also be useful as part of a map sense, and there is a growing body of evidence that birds are able to determine their approximate position on the Earth on the basis of geomagnetic cues. In addition to direct uses for orientation and navigation, magnetic information also seems to be able to influence other physiological processes, such as fattening and migratory motivation, as a trigger for changes in behavior. Although the behavioral responses to geomagnetic cues are relatively well understood, the physiological mechanisms enabling birds to sense the Earth's magnetic field are only starting to be understood, and understanding the magnetic sense(s) of animals, including birds, remains one of the most significant unsolved problems in biology. It is very challenging to sense magnetic fields as weak as that of the Earth using only biologically available materials. Only two basic mechanisms are considered theoretically viable in terrestrial animals: iron-mineral-based magnetoreception and radical-pair based magnetoreception. On the basis of current scientific evidence, iron-mineral-based magnetoreception and radical-pair-based magnetoreception mechanisms seem to exist in birds, but they seem to be used for different purposes. Plausible primary sensory molecules and a few brain areas involved in processing magnetic information have been identified in birds for each of these two types of magnetic senses. Nevertheless, we are still far away from understanding the detailed function of any of the at least two different magnetic senses existing in some if not all bird species, and, at present, no primary sensory structure has been identified beyond reasonable doubt to be the source of avian magnetoreception. This is an exciting but challenging field in which several major discoveries are likely to be made in the next 1–2 decades.","author":[{"family":"Mouritsen","given":"Henrik"}],"citation-key":"mouritsen2015","DOI":"10.1016/B978-0-12-407160-5.00008-7","editor":[{"family":"Scanes","given":"Colin G B T - Sturkie's Avian Physiology (Sixth Edition)"}],"event-place":"San Diego","ISBN":"978-0-12-407160-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"page":"113-133","publisher":"Academic Press","publisher-place":"San Diego","title":"Chapter 8 - Magnetoreception in Birds and Its Use for Long-Distance Migration","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124071605000087"},

  {"id":"muheim2018me","abstract":"Birds use different compass mechanisms based on celestial (stars, sun, skylight polarization pattern) and geomagnetic cues for orientation. Yet, much remains to be understood how birds actually use these compass mechanisms on their long-distance migratory journeys. Here, we assess in more detail the consequences of using different sun and magnetic compass mechanisms for the resulting bird migration routes during both autumn and spring migration. First, we calculated predicted flight routes to determine which of the compasses mechanisms lead to realistic and feasible migration routes starting at different latitudes during autumn and spring migration. We then compared the adaptive values of the different compass mechanisms by calculating distance ratios in relation to the shortest possible trajectory for three populations of nocturnal passerine migrants: northern wheatear Oenanthe oenanthe, pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca, and willow warbler Phylloscopus trochilus. Finally, we compared the predicted trajectories for different compass strategies with observed routes based on recent light-level geolocation tracking results for five individuals of northern wheatears migrating between Alaska and tropical Africa. We conclude that the feasibility of different compass routes varies greatly with latitude, migratory direction, migration season, and geographic location. Routes following a single compass course throughout the migratory journey are feasible for many bird populations, but the underlying compass mechanisms likely differ between populations. In many cases, however, the birds likely have to reorient once to a few times along the migration route and/or use map information to successfully reach their migratory destination.","author":[{"family":"Muheim","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Schmaljohann","given":"Heiko"},{"family":"Alerstam","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"muheim2018me","container-title":"Movement Ecology","DOI":"10.1186/s40462-018-0126-4","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"page":"8-8","title":"Feasibility of sun and magnetic compass mechanisms in avian long-distance migration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40462-018-0126-4","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"muheimMagneticCompassOrientation2002","abstract":"Skip to Next Section\nMagnetic compass orientation in birds has been shown to be light dependent. Results from behavioural studies indicate that magnetoreception capabilities are disrupted under light of peak wavelengths longer than 565 nm, and shifts in orientation have been observed at higher light intensities (43-44×1015 quanta s-1 m-2). To investigate further the function of the avian magnetic compass with respect to wavelength and intensity of light, we carried out orientation cage experiments with juvenile European robins, caught during their first autumn migration, exposed to light of 560.5 nm (green), 567.5 nm (green-yellow) and 617 nm (red) wavelengths at three different intensities (1 mW m-2, 5 mW m-2 and 10 mW m-2). We used monochromatic light of a narrow wavelength range (half bandwidth of 9-11 nm, compared with half bandwidths ranging between 30 nm and 70 nm used in other studies) and were thereby able to examine the magnetoreception mechanism in the expected transition zone between oriented and disoriented behaviour around 565 nm in more detail. We show (1) that European robins show seasonally appropriate migratory directions under 560.5 nm light, (2) that they are completely disoriented under 567.5 nm light under a broad range of intensities, (3) that they are able to orient under 617 nm light of lower intensities, although into a direction shifted relative to the expected migratory one, and (4) that magnetoreception is intensity dependent, leading to disorientation under higher intensities. Our results support the hypothesis that birds possess a light-dependent magnetoreception system based on magnetically sensitive, antagonistically interacting spectral mechanisms, with at least one high-sensitive short-wavelength mechanism and one low-sensitive long-wavelength mechanism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Muheim","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Bäckman","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Åkesson","given":"Susanne"}],"citation-key":"muheimMagneticCompassOrientation2002","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Biology","ISSN":"0022-0949, 1477-9145","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002,12,15]]},"language":"en","page":"3845-3856","PMID":"12432008","publisher":"The Company of Biologists Ltd","section":"Research Article","source":"jeb.biologists.org","title":"Magnetic compass orientation in European robins is dependent on both wavelength and intensity of light","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/24/3845","volume":"205"},

  {"id":"nathan2012jeb","abstract":"Integrating biomechanics, behavior and ecology requires a mechanistic understanding of the processes producing the movement of animals. This calls for contemporaneous biomechanical, behavioral and environmental data along movement pathways. A recently formulated unifying movement ecology paradigm facilitates the integration of existing biomechanics, optimality, cognitive and random paradigms for studying movement. We focus on the use of tri-axial acceleration (ACC) data to identify behavioral modes of GPS-tracked free-ranging wild animals and demonstrate its application to study the movements of griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus, Hablizl 1783). In particular, we explore a selection of nonlinear and decision tree methods that include support vector machines, classification and regression trees, random forest methods and artificial neural networks and compare them with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as a baseline for classifying behavioral modes. Using a dataset of 1035 groundtruthed ACC segments, we found that all methods can accurately classify behavior (80-90%) and, as expected, all nonlinear methods outperformed LDA. We also illustrate how ACC-identified behavioral modes provide the means to examine how vulture flight is affected by environmental factors, hence facilitating the integration of behavioral, biomechanical and ecological data. Our analysis of just over three-quarters of a million GPS and ACC measurements obtained from 43 free-ranging vultures across 9783 vulture-days suggests that their annual breeding schedule might be selected primarily in response to seasonal conditions favoring rising-air columns (thermals) and that rare long-range forays of up to 1750?km from the home range are performed despite potentially heavy energetic costs and a low rate of food intake, presumably to explore new breeding, social and long-term resource location opportunities. © 2012.

  {"id":"needham2019gace","abstract":"Mechanisms related to seasonal reproductive timing in vertebrates have received far more study in males than in females, despite the fact that female timing decisions dictate when rearing of offspring will occur. Production and release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) by the hypothalamus stimulates the pituitary to secrete gonadotropins, initiating the beginning stages of gonadal recrudescence and production of the sex steroids, testosterone and estradiol, which are necessary to prime the liver for secretion of yolk precursors in breeding female birds. While stimulation by the hypothalamus can occur during the pre-breeding period, egg development itself is likely regulated downstream of the hypothalamus. We used GnRH challenges to examine variation in breeding-stage-specific patterns of pituitary and ovarian responsiveness in free-living female dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) and also examined the ovary and liver for variation in mRNA expression of candidate genes. Baseline LH levels increased during the transition from pre-breeding to egg-development, however no significant difference was observed in post-GnRH injection levels for LH or sex steroids (testosterone and estradiol). Interestingly, a stage by time-point interaction was observed, with post-GnRH LH levels increasing over baseline during the pre-breeding stage, but not during the egg-development stage. We observed a decrease in liver mRNA expression of estradiol receptor-alpha, and glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors and a decrease in glucocorticoid receptor expression levels in the ovary. A decline in FSH receptor expression across stages was also observed in the ovary. Combined, our data suggest seasonal variation in female’s sensitivity to signals of HPG activity and energetic or stress signals. These data provide additional insight into the physiological mechanisms regulating onset of clutch initiation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Needham","given":"Katie B."},{"family":"Bergeon Burns","given":"Christy"},{"family":"Graham","given":"Jessica L."},{"family":"Bauer","given":"Carolyn M."},{"family":"Kittilson","given":"Jeffrey D."},{"family":"Ketterson","given":"Ellen D."},{"family":"Hahn","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Greives","given":"Timothy J."}],"citation-key":"needham2019gace","container-title":"General and Comparative Endocrinology","container-title-short":"General and Comparative Endocrinology","DOI":"10.1016/j.ygcen.2018.10.012","ISSN":"0016-6480","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"103-112","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Changes in processes downstream of the hypothalamus are associated with seasonal follicle development in a songbird, the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016648018301503","volume":"270"},

The model avoids making any irradiance threshold assumptions, or constraining the movement of the tag between dawn and dusk, which has limited the efficacy of previous models. Unlike previous models which relied on using previously calculated raw geolocations from outside sources, the new model uses irradiance data to produce the most probable track. The model generates two estimates of geographic positions per day (at dawn and dusk). Prior to this study, the model has been successfully evaluated for tags mounted on moorings, drifters, and in simulated cases. This paper documents the application of the model to wild caught swimming and diving mako sharks and blue marlin. The reconstructed tracks via the new model are compared to tracks adjusted using sea-surface temperature and to very accurate satellite-based tracks. The model performs well for the tested tags, which is surprising as these are pop-off satellite archival tags (PSATs), from which only a small fraction of the light record around approximately dusk and dawn is stored.

An online (real-time) version of such system can extremely extend its applications, especially for indoor mobile mapping. However, the real-time response issue of multisensors is a big challenge for an online SLAM system, due to the different sampling frequencies and processing time of different algorithms. In this paper, an online Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) integrated algorithm of LiDAR scan matching and IMU mechanization for Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) indoor navigation system is introduced. Since LiDAR scan matching is considerably more time consuming than the IMU mechanism, the real-time synchronous issue is solved via a one-step-error-state-transition method in EKF. Stationary and dynamic field tests had been performed using a UGV platform along typical corridor of office building. Compared to the traditional sequential postprocessed EKF algorithm, the proposed method can significantly mitigate the time delay of navigation outputs under the premise of guaranteeing the positioning accuracy, which can be used as an online navigation solution for indoor mobile mapping.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Niu","given":"Xiaoji"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Tong"},{"family":"Tang","given":"Jian"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Le"}],"citation-key":"niu2017mis","container-title":"Mobile Information Systems","DOI":"10.1155/2017/4802159","ISSN":"1574-017X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,7,3]]},"language":"en","page":"e4802159","publisher":"Hindawi","source":"www.hindawi.com","title":"An Online Solution of LiDAR Scan Matching Aided Inertial Navigation System for Indoor Mobile Mapping","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/misy/2017/4802159/","volume":"2017"},

The model suggests that the value creation potential of e-businesses hinges on four interdependent dimensions, namely: efficiency, complementarities, lock-in, and novelty. Our findings suggest that no single entrepreneurship or strategic management theory can fully explain the value creation potential of e-business. Rather, an integration of the received theoretical perspectives on value creation is needed. To enable such an integration, we offer the business model construct as a unit of analysis for future research on value creation in e-business. A business model depicts the design of transaction content, structure, and governance so as to create value through the exploitation of business opportunities.

  {"id":"nuijten2020jae","abstract":"GPS-tracking devices have been used in combination with a wide range of additional sensors to study animal behaviour, physiology and interaction with their environment. Tri-axial accelerometers allow researchers to remotely infer the behaviour of individuals, at all places and times. Collection of accelerometer data is relatively cheap in terms of energy usage, but the amount of raw data collected generally requires much storage space and is particularly demanding in terms of energy needed for data transmission. Here, we propose compressing the raw accelerometer (ACC) data into summary statistics within the tracking device (before transmission) to reduce data size, as a means to overcome limitations in storage and energy capacity. We explored this type of lossy data compression in the accelerometer data of tagged Bewick's swans Cygnus columbianus bewickii collected in spring 2017. Using software settings in which bouts of 2 s of both raw ACC data and summary statistics were collected in parallel but with different bout intervals to keep total data size comparable, we created the opportunity for a direct comparison of time budgets derived by the two data collection methods. We found that the data compression in our case yielded a six times reduction in data size per bout, and concurrent, similar decreases in storage and energy use of the device. We show that with the same accuracy of the behavioural classification, the freed memory and energy of the device can be used to increase the monitoring effort, resulting in a more detailed representation of the individuals’ time budget. Rare and/or short behaviours, such as daily roost flights, were picked up significantly more when collecting summary statistics instead of raw ACC data (but note differences in sampling rate). Such level of detail can be of essential importance, for instance to make a reliable estimate of the energy budgets of individuals. In conclusion, we argue that this type of lossy data compression can be a well-considered choice in study situations where limitations in energy and storage space of the device pose a problem. Ultimately, these developments can allow for long-term and nearly continuous remote monitoring of the behaviour of free-ranging animals.","author":[{"family":"Nuijten","given":"Rascha J.M."},{"family":"Gerrits","given":"Theo"},{"family":"Shamoun-Baranes","given":"Judy"},{"family":"Nolet","given":"Bart A"}],"citation-key":"nuijten2020jae","container-title":"Journal of Animal Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2656.13164","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"page":"237-247","title":"Less is more: On-board lossy compression of accelerometer data increases biologging capacity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2656.13164","volume":"89"},

  {"id":"obrien2006","abstract":"Satellite archival tags are widely being used to study the migratory dynamics and habitat utilization of diverse marine fish species. However positional estimates inferred from recorded light level data recorded by tags and light-based algorithms are notoriously unreliable at estimating latitude, particularly around the time of equinoxes and around the equator. Matching sea surface temperature (SST) measurements between those sampled by the tag and those observed by satellites has been identified as a means of refining latitude estimates. But use of SST to help resolve latitude has been hindered by the difficulty in manually matching data series. Here we present an algorithm (PSAT Tracker) that performs the task of SST matching automatically within a GIS environment. Given certain assumptions about swimming speed, the program selects multiple, matching candidate points for each day of SST data and then costs the most efficient path without recourse to a serial solution. Validation assessments of PSAT Tracker, based on simulation exercises and analysis of double tagging experiments, are presented. Features of the Tracker software and its integration with the EASy-GIS package are illustrated in the context of tagging studies of striped marlin (Tetrapturus audax) in the North Pacific. A comparative review of PSAT tracker relative to lightbased methods and increasingly used statistical approaches (Kalman filter, State-space model) is also presented, and desirable future directions for the field discussed.","author":[{"family":"O'Brien","given":"Frank J"},{"family":"Domeier","given":"Mike L"},{"family":"Lam","given":"Chi H"},{"family":"Tsontos","given":"Vardis M"}],"citation-key":"obrien2006","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"language":"en","page":"14","source":"Zotero","title":"Description of an improved algorithm for automated archival tag geolocational estimation based on the matching of satellite SST and in-situ temperature data: application to striped Marlin (Tetrapturus audax) in the North Pacific.","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"oehler2018epas","abstract":"Many models describing the Earth’s magnetic field exist and are maintained by international research organizations. However, no clear general overview of the cross-compared quality of these models is available. An evaluation of the internal component and of the anomaly field as estimated by a selection of nine geomagnetic models with global coverage is presented here. Anomaly field models are also compared with an external, independently processed marine dataset extracted from Shom’s (the French Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service) geophysical database. The comparative study shows that internal geomagnetic fields computed outside the provisional domain, up to degrees 12 or 13 of spherical harmonics (SH), can be considered as equivalent. Relative amplitude differences with the World Magnetic Model 2015 (WMM2015) and the 12th generation of the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF-12) taken as references are lower than 10 nT. For an extent reduced to the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean and western Mediterranean Sea, anomaly field models up to SH degree 720 and the 3rd version of the Earth Magnetic Anomaly Grid (EMAG2v3) at the equivalent 0.5° resolution are the closest models to the filtered marine data. However, they are significant spatial discrepancies and standard deviations of differences between models and data are about 65 nT. The 3-arc-minute World Digital Magnetic Anomaly Map (WDMAM) best reflects the unfiltered marine data, but with significant standard deviations of about 70 nT. Results demonstrate that any model can be used with insignificant errors to compute raw anomalies from total field measurements by removing the internal component of the Earth’s magnetic field. In addition, they suggest that the priority should be given to WDMAM for levelling and evaluating marine datasets and for computing enhanced high-resolution regional magnetic maps.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Oehler","given":"Jean-François"},{"family":"Rouxel","given":"Didier"},{"family":"Lequentrec-Lalancette","given":"Marie-Françoise"}],"citation-key":"oehler2018epas","container-title":"Earth, Planets and Space","container-title-short":"Earth, Planets and Space","DOI":"10.1186/s40623-018-0872-y","ISSN":"1880-5981","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,22]]},"page":"99","source":"BioMed Central","title":"Comparison of global geomagnetic field models and evaluation using marine datasets in the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean and western Mediterranean Sea","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40623-018-0872-y","volume":"70"},

  {"id":"omara2019fee","abstract":"Atmospheric conditions impact how animals use the aerosphere, and birds and bats should modify their flight to minimise energetic expenditure relative to changing wind conditions. To investigate how free-ranging straw-coloured fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) fly with changing wind support, we use data collected from bats fit with GPS loggers and an integrated triaxial accelerometer and measure flight speeds, wingbeat frequency, and overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) as an estimate for energetic expenditure. We predicted that if ODBA reflects energetic expenditure, then we should find a curvilinear relationship between ODBA and airspeed consistent with aerodynamic theory. We expected that bats would lower their airspeed with tailwind support and that ODBA will decrease with increasing tailwinds and increase with wingbeat frequency. We found that wingbeat frequency has the strongest positive relationship with ODBA. There was a small, but negative, relationship between airspeed and ODBA, and bats decreased ODBA with increasing tailwind. Bats flew at ground speeds of 9.6 ± 2.4 ms-1 (mean ± sd, range: 4.3 to 23.9 ms-1) and airspeeds of 10.2 ± 2.5 ms-1, and did not modify their wingbeat frequency with speed. Free-ranging straw-coloured fruit bats therefore exerted more total ODBA in headwinds but not when they changed their airspeed. It is possible that the flexibility in wingbeat kinematics may make flight of free-ranging bats less costly than currently predicted or alternatively that the combination of ODBA and airspeed at our scales of measurement does not reflect this relationship in straw-coloured fruit bats. Further work is needed to understand the full potential of free-ranging bat flight and how well bio-logging techniques reflect the costs of bat flight.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,27]]},"author":[{"family":"O'Mara","given":"M.

These devices record environmental light-level data that enable the reconstruction of daily positions from the time of twilight. However, all current methods for analysing geolocator data require manual pre-processing of raw records to eliminate twilight events showing unnatural variation in light levels, a step that is time-consuming and must be accomplished by a trained expert. Here, we propose and implement advanced machine learning techniques to automate this procedure and we apply them to 108 migration tracks of barn swallows (Hirundo rustica). We show that routes reconstructed from the automated pre-processing are comparable to those obtained from manual selection accomplished by a human expert. This raises the possibility of fully automating light-level geolocator data analysis and possibly analysing the large amount of data already collected on several species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Pancerasa","given":"Mattia"},{"family":"Sangiorgio","given":"Matteo"},{"family":"Ambrosini","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Saino","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Winkler","given":"David W."},{"family":"Casagrandi","given":"Renato"}],"citation-key":"pancerasaReconstructionLongdistanceBird2019","container-title":"Journal of The Royal Society Interface","container-title-short":"Journal of The Royal Society Interface","DOI":"10.1098/rsif.2019.0031","issue":"155","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,28]]},"page":"20190031","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Reconstruction of long-distance bird migration routes using advanced machine learning techniques on geolocator data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2019.0031","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"patterson2009jae","abstract":"Summary 1. ?Linking the movement and behaviour of animals to their environment is a central problem in ecology. Through the use of electronic tagging and tracking (ETT), collection of in situ data from free-roaming animals is now commonplace, yet statistical approaches enabling direct relation of movement observations to environmental conditions are still in development. 2. ?In this study, we examine the hidden Markov model (HMM) for behavioural analysis of tracking data. HMMs allow for prediction of latent behavioural states while directly accounting for the serial dependence prevalent in ETT data. Updating the probability of behavioural switches with tag or remote-sensing data provides a statistical method that links environmental data to behaviour in a direct and integrated manner. 3. ?It is important to assess the reliability of state categorization over the range of time-series lengths typically collected from field instruments and when movement behaviours are similar between movement states. Simulation with varying lengths of times series data and contrast between average movements within each state was used to test the HMMs ability to estimate movement parameters. 4. ?To demonstrate the methods in a realistic setting, the HMMs were used to categorize resident and migratory phases and the relationship between movement behaviour and ocean temperature using electronic tagging data from southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii). Diagnostic tools to evaluate the suitability of different models and inferential methods for investigating differences in behaviour between individuals are also demonstrated.","author":[{"family":"Patterson","given":"Toby A"},{"family":"Basson","given":"Marinelle"},{"family":"Bravington","given":"Mark V"},{"family":"Gunn","given":"John S"}],"citation-key":"patterson2009jae","container-title":"Journal of Animal Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01583.x","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,11]]},"page":"1113-1123","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","title":"Classifying movement behaviour in relation to environmental conditions using hidden Markov models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01583.x","volume":"78"},
  {"id":"patterson2019ee","abstract":"The behavior of many wild animals remains a mystery, as it is difficult to quantify behavior of species that cannot be easily followed throughout their daily or seasonal movements. Accelerometers can solve some of these mysteries, as they collect activity data at a high temporal resolution (<1 s), can be relatively small (<1 g) so they minimally disrupt behavior, and are increasingly capable of recording data for long periods. Nonetheless, there is a need for increased validation of methods to classify animal behavior from accelerometers to promote widespread adoption of this technology in ecology. We assessed the accuracy of six different behavioral assignment methods for two species of seabird, thick‐billed murres (Uria lomvia) and black‐legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla). We identified three behaviors using tri‐axial accelerometers: standing, swimming, and flying, after classifying diving using a pressure sensor for murres. We evaluated six classification methods relative to independent classifications from concurrent GPS tracking data. We used four variables for classification: depth, wing beat frequency, pitch, and dynamic acceleration. Average accuracy for all methods was >98% for murres, and 89% and 93% for kittiwakes during incubation and chick rearing, respectively. Variable selection showed that classification accuracy did not improve with more than two (kittiwakes) or three (murres) variables. We conclude that simple methods of behavioral classification can be as accurate for classifying basic behaviors as more complex approaches, and that identifying suitable accelerometer metrics is more important than using a particular classification method when the objective is to develop a daily activity or energy budget.

  {"id":"portugal2018mee","abstract":"The use of biologging technology has increased exponentially over the last decade, allowing us to study animal behaviour at a level of detail not previously possible. It is clear from recent meta-analyses that the attachment of such devices can have negative effects on individual animals, particularly their behaviour and physiology. In recognition of this, a commonly applied rule is to ensure that devices borne by flying animals weigh less than 5% of their body mass. Over time, the continuing miniaturization of devices should facilitate the deployment of devices that are an ever-decreasing fraction of animal mass. Despite these considerations regarding device mass, here we show that there has been no apparent reduction in the relationship between body mass and the mass of logging devices over the last 48 years. Using a meta-analytical approach, we demonstrate that the ongoing miniaturization of animal-borne devices has resulted not in a decrease in the relative device mass borne by animals, but instead has prompted researchers to measure smaller and smaller species. We recommend that researchers better exploit the ongoing miniaturization of devices to reduce the relative mass of the devices borne by animals, and avoid blind adoption of the 5% or any other arbitrary rule when designing research programs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Portugal","given":"Steven J."},{"family":"White","given":"Craig R."}],"citation-key":"portugal2018mee","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.13013","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/2041-210X.13013","page":"1662-1666","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Miniaturization of biologgers is not alleviating the 5% rule","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.13013","volume":"9"},

The model MCC++ employs Monte Carlo algorithm for radiative transfer simulation and takes into account aerosol and molecular scattering, gas and aerosol absorption, and Lambertian surface albedo. The model treats a spherically symmetrical atmosphere. Relation of the estimated derivatives with other forms of radiance derivatives: the weighting functions used in gas retrieval and the air mass factors used in the DOAS retrieval algorithms, is obtained.Validation of the model against other radiative models is overviewed. The computing time of the intensity for the MCC++ model is about that for radiative models treating sphericity of the atmosphere approximately and is significantly shorter than that for the full spherical models used in the comparisons.

  {"id":"prince2015gcba","abstract":"Much of the recent changes in North American climate have occurred during the winter months, and as result, overwintering birds represent important sentinels of anthropogenic climate change. While there is mounting evidence that bird populations are responding to a warming climate (e.g., poleward shifts) questions remain as to whether these species-specific responses are resulting in community-wide changes. Here, we test the hypothesis that a changing winter climate should favor the formation of winter bird communities dominated by warm-adapted species. To do this, we quantified changes in community composition using a functional index - the Community Temperature Index (CTI) - which measures the balance between low- and high-temperature dwelling species in a community. Using data from Project FeederWatch, an international citizen science program, we quantified spatiotemporal changes in winter bird communities (n = 38 bird species) across eastern North America and tested the influence of changes in winter minimum temperature over a 22-year period. We implemented a jackknife analysis to identify those species most influential in driving changes at the community level and the population dynamics (e.g., extinction or colonization) responsible for these community changes. Since 1990, we found that the winter bird community structure has changed with communities increasingly composed of warm-adapted species. This reshuffling of winter bird communities was strongest in southerly latitudes and driven primarily by local increases in abundance and regional patterns of colonization by southerly birds. CTI tracked patterns of changing winter temperature at different temporal scales ranging from 1 to 35 years. We conclude that a shifting winter climate has provided an opportunity for smaller, southerly distributed species to colonize new regions and promote the formation of unique winter bird assemblages throughout eastern North America.","author":[{"family":"Princé","given":"Karine"},{"family":"Zuckerberg","given":"Benjamin"}],"citation-key":"prince2015gcba","container-title":"Global Change Biology","DOI":"10.1111/gcb.12740","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"page":"572-585","title":"Climate change in our backyards: The reshuffling of North America's winter bird communities","type":"article-journal","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"pulido2010pnasusa","abstract":"Global warming is impacting biodiversity by altering the distribution, abundance, and phenology of a wide range of animal and plant species. One of the best documented responses to recent climate change is alterations in the migratory behavior of birds, but the mechanisms underlying these phenotypic adjustments are largely unknown. This knowledge is still crucial to predict whether populations of migratory birds will adapt to a rapid increase in temperature. We monitored migratory behavior in a population of blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) to test for evolutionary responses to recent climate change. Using a common garden experiment in time and captive breeding we demonstrated a genetic reduction in migratory activity and evolutionary change in phenotypic plasticity of migration onset. An artificial selection experiment further revealed that residency will rapidly evolve in completely migratory bird populations if selection for shorter migration distance persists. Our findings suggest that current alterations of the environment are favoring birds wintering closer to the breeding grounds and that populations of migratory birds have strongly responded to these changes in selection. The reduction of migratory activity is probably an important evolutionary process in the adaptation of migratory birds to climate change, because it reduces migration costs and facilitates the rapid adjustment to the shifts in the timing of food availability during reproduction.","author":[{"family":"Pulido","given":"Francisco"},{"family":"Berthold","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"pulido2010pnasusa","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0910361107","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"page":"7341-7346","title":"Current selection for lower migratory activity will drive the evolution of residency in a migratory bird population","type":"article-journal","volume":"107"},

Although several species are known to use magnetic cues as a surrogate for latitude [4-8], it is not known how any animal perceives longitude [1, 9-11]. Magnetic parameters appear to be unpromising as longitudinal markers because they typically vary more in a north-south rather than an east-west direction [1, 2, 9, 10]. Here we report, however, that hatchling loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) from Florida, USA, when exposed to magnetic fields that exist at two locations with the same latitude but on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean, responded by swimming in different directions that would, in each case, help them advance along their circular migratory route. The results demonstrate for the first time that longitude can be encoded into the magnetic positioning system of a migratory animal. Because turtles also assess north-south position magnetically [4, 8, 12], the findings imply that loggerheads have a navigational system that exploits the Earth's magnetic field as a kind of bicoordinate magnetic map from which both longitudinal and latitudinal information can be extracted. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","author":[{"family":"Putman","given":"Nathan F."},{"family":"Endres","given":"Courtney S."},{"family":"Lohmann","given":"Catherine M.F."},{"family":"Lohmann","given":"Kenneth J."}],"citation-key":"putman2011cb","container-title":"Current Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.cub.2011.01.057","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,3]]},"page":"463-466","publisher":"Cell Press","title":"Longitude perception and bicoordinate magnetic maps in sea turtles","type":"article-journal","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"qasem2012po","abstract":"Dynamic body acceleration (DBA) has been used as a proxy for energy expenditure in logger-equipped animals, with researchers summing the acceleration (overall dynamic body acceleration--ODBA) from the three orthogonal axes of devices. The vector of the dynamic body acceleration (VeDBA) may be a better proxy so this study compared ODBA and VeDBA as proxies for rate of oxygen consumption using humans and 6 other species. Twenty-one humans on a treadmill ran at different speeds while equipped with two loggers, one in a straight orientation and the other skewed, while rate of oxygen consumption (VO2) was recorded. Similar data were obtained from animals but using only one (straight) logger. In humans, both ODBA and VeDBA were good proxies for VO2 with all r(2) values exceeding 0.88, although ODBA accounted for slightly but significantly more of the variation in VO2 than did VeDBA (P<0.03). There were no significant differences between ODBA and VeDBA in terms of the change in VO2 estimated by the acceleration data in a simulated situation of the logger being mounted straight but then becoming skewed (P = 0.744). In the animal study, ODBA and VeDBA were again good proxies for VO2 with all r(2) values exceeding 0.70 although, again, ODBA accounted for slightly, but significantly, more of the variation in VO2 than did VeDBA (P<0.03). The simultaneous contraction of muscles, inserted variously for limb stability, may produce muscle oxygen use that at least partially equates with summing components to derive DBA. Thus, a vectorial summation to derive DBA cannot be assumed to be the more 'correct' calculation. However, although within the limitations of our simple study, ODBA appears a marginally better proxy for VO2. In the unusual situation where researchers are unable to guarantee at least reasonably consistent device orientation, they should use VeDBA as a proxy for VO2.","author":[{"family":"Qasem","given":"Lama"},{"family":"Cardew","given":"Antonia"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Alexis"},{"family":"Griffiths","given":"Iwan"},{"family":"Halsey","given":"Lewis"},{"family":"Shepard","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Gleiss","given":"Adrian"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Rory"}],"citation-key":"qasem2012po","container-title":"PloS one","container-title-short":"PloS one","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0031187","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,2,17]]},"page":"e31187","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Tri-Axial Dynamic Acceleration as a Proxy for Animal Energy Expenditure; Should We Be Summing Values or Calculating the Vector?","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

As part of a study of divergence of chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, populations, established in New Zealand from a common source in the early 1900s, we tested the hypotheses that the timing of migration and breeding are under genetic control and that the populations genetically differ in these traits despite phenotypic overlap in timing in the wild. Representatives of families from two populations were collected within a day or two of each other, reared in a common environment, and then released to sea from each of two different rivers, while other family representatives were retained in fresh water to maturity. The date of maturation of fish held in fresh water and the dates of return from the ocean and maturation of fish released to sea all showed significant differences between the two populations and among families within populations. The very high heritabilities and genetic correlations estimated for migration and maturation date indicated that these traits would respond rapidly to selection. Combined with the results of related studies on these chinook salmon populations, it appears that spawning time may not only evolve during the initial phases of divergence, but it may play an important role in accelerating divergence in other traits.","author":[{"family":"Quinn","given":"Thomas P"},{"family":"Unwin","given":"Martin J."},{"family":"Kinnison","given":"Michael T"}],"citation-key":"quinn2000e","container-title":"Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/j.0014-3820.2000.tb00569.x","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000]]},"page":"1372-1385","title":"Evolution of temporal isolation in the wild: Genetic divergence in timing of migration and breeding by introduced chinook salmon populations","type":"article-journal","volume":"54"},

A female black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa limosa captured on the breeding grounds in the Netherlands in 2013 and recaptured in 2014 was outfitted with both an Intigeo geolocator and an UvA-BiTS GPS-tracker. The GPS positions show that, after its breeding season in 2013, the godwit flew 2035 km nonstop from the Netherlands to southern Spain. It then spent the entire nonbreeding season in the southern part of the Iberian Peninsula before returning to the Netherlands the following spring, stopping for 7 days in the delta of the Ebro River in Spain, and again for a day in central Belgium. To compare the geolocation and GPS data, we analysed the geolocation data with two open-source software packages: one using a threshold method (GeoLight) and the other a template-fit approach (FLightR). Estimates using GeoLight, on average, deviated from the individual's true position by 495.5 ± 1031.2 km (great circle distance with equinoxes excluded), while FLightR estimates deviated by 43.3 ± 51.5 km (great circle distance with equinoxes included). Arrival and departure schedules estimated by FLightR were within 12 h of those determined by the GPS tracker, whereas GeoLight's estimates were less precise. For the analysed track, FLightR represents an improvement over GeoLight; if true for other species and conditions, FLightR will hopefully help establish more precise and accurate uses of geolocation data in tracking studies.

The requirement of portability places severe restrictions on size and weight, which in turn limits the amount of energy that is continuously available to maintain system operability. For these reasons, efficient energy utilization has become one of the key challenges to the designer of battery-powered embedded computing systems. In this paper, we first present a novel analytical battery model, which can be used for the battery lifetime estimation. The high quality of the proposed model is demonstrated with measurements and simulations. Using this battery model, we introduce a new “battery-aware” cost function, which will be used for optimizing the lifetime of the battery. This cost function generalizes the traditional minimization metric, namely the energy consumption of the system. We formulate the problem of battery-aware task scheduling on a single processor with multiple voltages. Then, we prove several important mathematical properties of the cost function. Based on these properties, we propose several algorithms for task ordering and voltage assignment, including optimal idle period insertion to exercise charge recovery.

Migrants are key components of biological systems in high latitude regions, where the speed and magnitude of climate change impacts are greatest. They also rely on highly productive seasonal habitats, including wetlands and ocean upwellings that, with climate change, may become less food-rich and predictable in space and time. While migrants are adapted to adjust their behaviour with annual changes in the weather, the decoupling of climatic variables between geographically separate breeding and nonbreeding grounds is beginning to result in mistimed migration. Furthermore, human land-use and activity patterns will constrain the ability of many species to modify their migratory routes and may increase the stress induced by climate change. Adapting conservation strategies for migrants in the light of climate change will require substantial shifts in site designation policies, flexibility of management strategies and the integration of forward planning for both people and wildlife. While adaptation to changes may be feasible for some terrestrial systems, wildlife in the marine ecosystem may be more dependent on the degree of climate change mitigation that is achievable.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Robinson","given":"Ra"},{"family":"Crick","given":"Hqp"},{"family":"Learmonth","given":"Ja"},{"family":"Maclean","given":"Imd"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Cd"},{"family":"Bairlein","given":"F"},{"family":"Forchhammer","given":"Mc"},{"family":"Francis","given":"Cm"},{"family":"Gill","given":"Ja"},{"family":"Godley","given":"Bj"},{"family":"Harwood","given":"J"},{"family":"Hays","given":"Gc"},{"family":"Huntley","given":"B"},{"family":"Hutson","given":"Am"},{"family":"Pierce","given":"Gj"},{"family":"Rehfisch","given":"Mm"},{"family":"Sims","given":"Dw"},{"family":"Santos","given":"Bm"},{"family":"Sparks","given":"Th"},{"family":"Stroud","given":"Da"},{"family":"Visser","given":"Me"}],"citation-key":"robinson2009esr","container-title":"Endangered Species Research","container-title-short":"Endang.

They show that declines are not restricted to rare and threatened species—those once considered common and wide-spread are also diminished. These results have major implications for ecosystem integrity, the conservation of wildlife more broadly, and policies associated with the protection of birds and native ecosystems on which they depend.\nScience, this issue p. 120\nSpecies extinctions have defined the global biodiversity crisis, but extinction begins with loss in abundance of individuals that can result in compositional and functional changes of ecosystems. Using multiple and independent monitoring networks, we report population losses across much of the North American avifauna over 48 years, including once-common species and from most biomes. Integration of range-wide population trajectories and size estimates indicates a net loss approaching 3 billion birds, or 29% of 1970 abundance. A continent-wide weather radar network also reveals a similarly steep decline in biomass passage of migrating birds over a recent 10-year period.

We hypothesized that phenotypic divergence might follow from differential regulation of genes encoding key steps in hormone biosynthesis and thus the rate of hormone production. We tested this hypothesis in relation to the steroid hormone testosterone by comparing two subspecies of junco (Junco hyemalis) in the wild and in captivity. These subspecies have diverged over the last 10–15kyears in multiple testosterone-mediated traits, including aggression, ornamentation, and body size. We show that variation in gonadal gene expression along the steroid biosynthetic pathway predicts phenotypic divergence within and among subspecies, and that the more androgenized subspecies exhibits a more prolonged time-course of elevated testosterone following exogenous stimulation. Our results point to specific genes that fulfill key conditions for phenotypic evolution because they vary functionally in their expression among individuals and between populations, and they map onto population variation in phenotype in a common garden.

However, activity level is poorly known for free-living animals because it is difficult to quantify activity in the field in a consistent, cost-effective and non-invasive way. This article presents a new method to estimate activity level with time-of-detection data from camera traps (or more generally any remote sensors), fitting a flexible circular distribution to these data to describe the underlying activity schedule, and calculating overall proportion of time active from this. Using simulations and a case study for a range of small- to medium-sized mammal species, we find that activity level can reliably be estimated using the new method. The method depends on the key assumption that all individuals in the sampled population are active at the peak of the daily activity cycle. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence suggesting that this assumption is likely to be met for many species, but may be less likely met in large predators, or in high-latitude winters. Further research is needed to establish stronger evidence on the validity of this assumption in specific cases; however, the approach has the potential to provide an effective, non-invasive alternative to existing methods for quantifying population activity levels.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Rowcliffe","given":"J.

  {"id":"roy2020","abstract":"Background Considerable progress in our understanding of long-distance migration has been achieved thanks to the use of small lightweight geolocator devices. Such global location sensors (GLS) are particularly suitable for studying non-breeding movement and behaviour due to their small size and low energy consumption allowing multiyear deployment. Errors of geolocation are however important, difficult to estimate, have a complex structure leading to poor precision and accuracy. Therefore, understanding movement ecology of short-distance migrants or resident birds during extensive time periods remains challenging. We aimed at elucidating the sex-specific marine space uses of a resident tropical seabird, the masked booby over the full annual life cycle, including the breeding and non-breeding periods.\nMethods A total of 34 GLS were deployed on male and female masked boobies at the Fernando de Noronha archipelago (Brazil), and 31 of them were recovered and provided year-round data. Error range of geographical positions and habitat use of masked boobies were estimated from light-derived positions and temperature data. Synchronicity between movement and saltwater immersion data was investigated through a wavelet analysis.\nResults Masked boobies showed a resident behaviour over their entire annual cycle. We inferred from the wavelet analysis that birds traveled way and back from the colony on consecutive trips of short length (approx 2-4 days) and short range (approx 100-300 km) at the east of the colony. Trip duration and range depended on the sex of the individual and on the time of the year. Females had farther ranges than males during the pre-breeding period. Trip duration increased gradually from the end of the breeding period to the post-breeding period, probably due to the release of the central-place breeding constraints.\nConclusions Despite inherent limits of light-based geolocation, synchronicity analysis of geolocation data revealed year round whereabouts of a resident tropical seabird and sex-specific movement behaviour. Such an approach based on the estimation of synchronicity between light-based coordinates data and any other external data (behavioural or environmental) could be used more broadly to investigate resident or short-migrants animal movement based on GLS data.","author":[{"family":"Roy","given":"Amédée"},{"family":"Karine","given":"Delord"},{"family":"Tavares Nunes","given":"Guilherme"},{"family":"Barbraud","given":"Christophe"},{"family":"Bugoni","given":"Leandro"},{"family":"Bertrand","given":"Sophie"}],"citation-key":"roy2020","DOI":"10.21203/rs.3.rs-118834/v1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,30]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"Did the animal move?

  {"id":"royertatomawed","abstract":"Current lightbased geolocation techniques used to identify migration routes of highly mobile species have inherent limitations, depending on the type of tag technologies used. Recovered data storage tags provide detailed time series of light-levels suited for extensive post-processing, while pop-up satellite tags (PSATs) are bandwidth-limited and generally provide samples only at critical times of the day. An alternative approach is to detect a sunrise or sunset event and transmit only this information, thus freeing bandwidth for depth or temperature data. We show here that this geolocation technique retains the essential information to correct for known problems such as errors at the equinoxes. We describe the suitable model for such data, as well as the behavior of resulting location error and bias in simulated cases. Illustrations from PSAT tags at the ocean’s surface and on a freely-swimming fish reveal a highly non-Gaussian error distribution. To solve for this, we present a more generalized estimation framework than linear Gaussian models, based on an extension of the Kalman filter. We apply iterative nonlinear Least squares to address non-Gaussian errors, non-linear dynamics and missing data. The proposed optimization method may include coastlines or bathymetric limits as hard constraints. Our results indicate that sunrise/sunset-based geolocation is a viable technique technique to surmount tag design or engineering limitations when tracking pelagic fish.","author":[{"family":"Royer","given":"François"},{"family":"Lutcavage","given":"Molly"}],"citation-key":"royertatomawed","container-title":"Tagging and Tracking of Marine Animals with Electronic Devices","page":"323-341","title":"Positioning Pelagic Fish from Sunrise and Sunset Times: Complex Observation Errors Call for Constrained, Robust Modeling","type":"chapter"},
  {"id":"rubolini2007cr","abstract":"In the course of the 20th century, migratory birds have shown rapid phenological changes in response to climate change. However, the spatial variability of phenological changes, as well as their intraspecific consistency, remains largely unexplored. Here we analysed 672 estimates of change in first arrival dates of migratory birds and 289 estimates of mean/median arrival dates, based on time series with a minimum duration of 15 yr, collected across Europe from 1960 to 2006. There were highly significant advances in arrival date, significantly more so for first than mean arrival date. Change in arrival dates significantly varied among species, implying that response to climate change is a species-specific feature, and showed substantial phylogenetic effects, since ca. 50 % of the variation in the observed trends was attributable to differences among species. The advance in first arrival date was weaker at extreme latitudes and stronger at intermediate latitudes, while geographic variation in mean arrival dates was less pronounced. Both first and mean arrival dates advanced the most for short- compared to long-distance migrants. These findings emphasize the reliability of estimates of phenological trends of avian species, which are therefore suitable to be included in comparative analyses aimed at identifying species-specific traits that favour adaptation to climatic changes. In addition, our results suggest that analyses of factors that have affected phenological responses to climate change should take into account spatial variation in the response, which could be due to spatial differences in the strength of climate change. © Inter-Research 2007.","author":[{"family":"Rubolini","given":"Diego"},{"family":"Møller","given":"Anders P"},{"family":"Rainio","given":"Kalle"},{"family":"Lehikoinen","given":"Esa"}],"citation-key":"rubolini2007cr","container-title":"Climate Research","DOI":"10.3354/cr00720","issue":"1-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"page":"135-146","title":"Intraspecific consistency and geographic variability in temporal trends of spring migration phenology among european bird species","type":"article-journal","volume":"35"},

In addition, we use known-origin samples to validate our model and assess potentially important impacts of isotopic and morphological covariates (age, sex, and breeding location). Our results show that despite relatively high levels of mixing across their breeding and nonbreeding ranges, moderate levels of migratory connectivity exist along an east-west gradient. In addition, combining stable isotopes with geographic variation in wing length improved the precision of breeding assignments by 10% and 37% compared to assignments based on isotopes alone or wing length alone, respectively. These results demonstrate that geographical variation in morphological traits can greatly improve estimates of migratory connectivity when combined with other intrinsic markers (e.g., stable isotopes or genetic data). The wealth of morphological data available from museum specimens across the world represents a tremendously valuable, but largely untapped, resource that is widely applicable for quantifying patterns of migratory connectivity. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.","author":[{"family":"Rushing","given":"Clark S"},{"family":"Ryder","given":"Thomas B"},{"family":"Saracco","given":"James F."},{"family":"Marra","given":"Peter P."}],"citation-key":"rushing2014ea","container-title":"Ecological Applications","DOI":"10.1890/13-1091.1","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"page":"445-456","title":"Assessing migratory connectivity for a long-distance migratory bird using multiple intrinsic markers","type":"article-journal","volume":"24"},

The suggested applications are for studies in the field of human movement. In the proposed EKF, the quaternion associated with the body rotation is included in the state vector together with the bias of the aiding system sensors. Moreover, in addition to the in-line procedure of sensor bias compensation, the measurement noise covariance matrix is adapted, to guard against the effects which body motion and temporary magnetic disturbance may have on the reliability of measurements of gravity and earth's magnetic field, respectively. By computer simulations and experimental validation with human hand orientation motion signals, improvements in the accuracy of orientation estimates are demonstrated for the proposed EKF, as compared with filter implementations where either the in-line calibration procedure, the adaptive mechanism for weighting the measurements of the aiding system sensors, or both are not implemented.","author":[{"family":"Sabatini","given":"A M"}],"citation-key":"sabatini2006itbe","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","DOI":"10.1109/TBME.2006.875664","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"page":"1346-1356","title":"Quaternion-based extended Kalman filter for determining orientation by inertial and magnetic sensing","type":"article-journal","volume":"53"},
  {"id":"sakamoto2009po","abstract":"An ethogram is a catalogue of discrete behaviors typically employed by a species. Traditionally animal behavior has been recorded by observing study individuals directly. However, this approach is difficult, often impossible, in the case of behaviors which occur in remote areas and/or at great depth or altitude. The recent development of increasingly sophisticated, animal-borne data loggers, has started to overcome this problem. Accelerometers are particularly useful in this respect because they can record the dynamic motion of a body in e.g. flight, walking, or swimming. However, classifying behavior using body acceleration characteristics typically requires prior knowledge of the behavior of free-ranging animals. Here, we demonstrate an automated procedure to categorize behavior from body acceleration, together with the release of a user-friendly computer application, \"Ethographer\". We evaluated its performance using longitudinal acceleration data collected from a foot-propelled diving seabird, the European shag, Phalacrocorax aristotelis. The time series data were converted into a spectrum by continuous wavelet transformation. Then, each second of the spectrum was categorized into one of 20 behavior groups by unsupervised cluster analysis, using k-means methods. The typical behaviors extracted were characterized by the periodicities of body acceleration. Each categorized behavior was assumed to correspond to when the bird was on land, in flight, on the sea surface, diving and so on. The behaviors classified by the procedures accorded well with those independently defined from depth profiles. Because our approach is performed by unsupervised computation of the data, it has the potential to detect previously unknown types of behavior and unknown sequences of some behaviors.

  {"id":"salstein2008jgra","abstract":"Operational analyses from the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) provide, among other quantities, atmospheric surface pressure. This field is especially useful for data processing and interpretation of altimeter and gravity satellite missions like Jason-1 and GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment). Quantitative use of this pressure field, however, requires knowledge of its uncertainties. To assess these uncertainties, we compare NCEP and ECMWF analyses of surface pressure to an extensive set of surface barometric observations for the period 2001?2005, both land- and ocean-based, as well as to each other. Differences between each analysis and the observations are quite similar, indicating that both analyses generally fit the station observations equally well. Such differences, including both bias and variance about the bias, are largest over parts of the Southern Ocean, and over Asia, central Africa, and Antarctica. These bias and variance differences between the NCEP and ECMWF surface pressure fields change only slightly over the period of study. More importantly, though, such differences are substantially smaller than those found by previous studies for an earlier period (1993?1995), suggesting recent improvements in both analyses. The largest differences are found over high latitudes, particularly over Antarctica, and in the respective winter hemisphere. Much of the differences occur on rapid timescales, though with a significant portion at timescales longer than 1?2 months. The potential impact of such uncertainties on de-aliasing and interpreting sea level and gravity data from altimeter and GRACE missions is discussed.","author":[{"family":"Salstein","given":"David A"},{"family":"Ponte","given":"Rui M"},{"family":"Cady-Pereira","given":"Karen"}],"citation-key":"salstein2008jgra","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","DOI":"10.1029/2007JD009531","issue":"D14","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,7]]},"publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","title":"Uncertainties in atmospheric surface pressure fields from global analyses","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2007JD009531","volume":"113"},

  {"id":"sarkka2017isj","abstract":"This paper presents a calibration method for consumer-grade accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers. Considering the calibration of consumer-grade sensors, it is essential that no specialized equipment is required to create reference signals. In addition, the less is required from the reference signals, the more suitable the method is on the field. In the proposed method, the novelty in the calibration of the gyroscopes lies in the exploitation of only the known net rotations between the positions in a multi-position calibration. For accelerometers and magnetometers, the innovation is that the direction of reference signals, the gravity and the magnetic field of the Earth, are estimated with calibration parameters. As a consequence, no precise absolute alignment of the sensors is needed in the calibration. The rotations need not be done about a constant axis. In the proposed method, the biases, scale factors, misalignments, and cross-coupling errors for all the sensors as well as hard iron and soft iron effect for magnetometers were modelled. In addition, the drift of the sensors during the calibration was estimated. As a result, all the sensors were calibrated at once to the same frame, exploiting only a cube and a jig and thus, the method is eligible in the field. To estimate the quality of the calibration results, 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the calibration parameters. Simulations were done to indicate that the calibration method is unbiased.","author":[{"family":"Särkkä","given":"O"},{"family":"Nieminen","given":"T"},{"family":"Suuriniemi","given":"S"},{"family":"Kettunen","given":"L"}],"citation-key":"sarkka2017isj","container-title":"IEEE Sensors Journal","DOI":"10.1109/JSEN.2017.2694488","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"page":"3470-3481","title":"A Multi-Position Calibration Method for Consumer-Grade Accelerometers, Gyroscopes, and Magnetometers to Field Conditions","type":"article-journal","volume":"17"},
  {"id":"schmaljohann2009jeb","abstract":"Skip to Next Section\nBirds adjust their flight behaviour to the physical properties of the air. Lift and drag, the two major properties in aerodynamics, are highly dependent on air density. With decreasing air density drag is reduced and lift per wingbeat decreases. According to flight mechanical theory, wingbeat frequency and air speed should increase with decreasing air density, i.e. increasing flight altitude. Although wind tunnel experiments have shed light on many aspects of avian flight, the effect of air density remained ambiguous, because air density could not be adjusted in wind tunnels, until now. By means of radar we recorded tracks of several thousand free-flying individual birds during nocturnal migration. From these tracks we derived wingbeat frequencies and air speeds covering air densities from 0.84 kg m–3 to 1.13 kg m–3, corresponding to an altitudinal range of about 3000 m. We demonstrate here with this sample of nocturnal migrants that: (1) wingbeat frequency decreases with air density (which corresponds to an increase in flap-gliding flyers by 0.4 Hz km–1 and in bounding flyers by 1.1 Hz km–1), (2) reducing wingbeat frequency to equivalent sea level values did not abolish the dependency on air density, as expected by flight mechanical theory, and (3) bounding flyers show a higher response in their flight behavioural adjustments to changes in air density than flap-gliding flyers. With respect to air speed flap-gliding flyers increase their air speed by 1.0 m s–1 km–1 and bounding flyers by 1.4 m s–1 km–1.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Schmaljohann","given":"H."},{"family":"Liechti","given":"F."}],"citation-key":"schmaljohann2009jeb","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Biology","DOI":"10.1242/jeb.031435","ISSN":"0022-0949, 1477-9145","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,11,15]]},"language":"en","page":"3633-3642","PMID":"19880724","publisher":"The Company of Biologists Ltd","section":"Research Article","source":"jeb.biologists.org","title":"Adjustments of wingbeat frequency and air speed to air density in free-flying migratory birds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/22/3633","volume":"212"},

A previous study reported that birds are completely randomly oriented in a horizontal north-south magnetic field with 0° inclination angle. This seems counter-intuitive, because birds using an inclination compass should be able to separate the north-south axis from the east-west axis, so that bimodal orientation might be expected in a horizontal field. Furthermore, little is known about how shallow inclination angles migratory birds can still use for orientation. In this study, we tested the magnetic compass orientation of night-migratory Eurasian blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) in magnetic fields with 5° and 0° inclination. At 5° inclination, the birds oriented as well as they did in the normal 67° inclined field in Oldenburg. In contrast, they were completely randomly oriented in the horizontal field, showing no sign of bimodality. Our results indicate that the inclination limit for the magnetic compass of the blackcap is below 5° and that these birds indeed seem completely unable to use their magnetic compass for orientation in a horizontal magnetic field.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Schwarze","given":"Susanne"},{"family":"Steenken","given":"Friederike"},{"family":"Thiele","given":"Nadine"},{"family":"Kobylkov","given":"Dmitry"},{"family":"Lefeldt","given":"Nele"},{"family":"Dreyer","given":"David"},{"family":"Schneider","given":"Nils-Lasse"},{"family":"Mouritsen","given":"Henrik"}],"citation-key":"schwarze2016sr","container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/srep33805","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,26]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"33805","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Migratory blackcaps can use their magnetic compass at 5 degrees inclination, but are completely random at 0 degrees inclination","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep33805","volume":"6"},

Accelerometers, for example, have been used in several studies to measure body movement, posture, and energy expenditure, although predominantly in marine animals. In many studies, behaviour is often inferred from expert interpretation of sensor data and not validated with direct observations of the animal. The aim of this study was to derive models that could be used to classify oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) behaviour based on sensor data. We measured the location, speed, and tri-axial acceleration of three oystercatchers using a flexible GPS tracking system and conducted simultaneous visual observations of the behaviour of these birds in their natural environment. We then used these data to develop three supervised classification trees of behaviour and finally applied one of the models to calculate time-activity budgets. The model based on accelerometer data developed to classify three behaviours (fly, terrestrial locomotion, and no movement) was much more accurate (cross-validation error = 0.14) than the model based on GPS-speed alone (cross-validation error = 0.35). The most parsimonious acceleration model designed to classify eight behaviours could distinguish five: fly, forage, body care, stand, and sit (cross-validation error = 0.28); other behaviours that were observed, such as aggression or handling of prey, could not be distinguished. Model limitations and potential improvements are discussed. The workflow design presented in this study can facilitate model development, be adapted to a wide range of species, and together with the appropriate measurements, can foster the study of behaviour and habitat use of free living animals throughout their annual routine. © 2012 Shamoun-Baranes et al.","author":[{"family":"Shamoun-Baranes","given":"Judy"},{"family":"Bom","given":"Roeland"},{"family":"Loon","given":"E Emiel","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Ens","given":"Bruno J."},{"family":"Oosterbeek","given":"Kees"},{"family":"Bouten","given":"Willem"}],"citation-key":"shamoun-baranes2012po","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0037997","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"title":"From sensor data to animal behaviour: An oystercatcher example","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

We determine environmental, behavioural, and physiological causes of survival in immature birds that roam from wintering sites in India, Bhutan, and Nepal towards summer areas in Tibet and Mongolia. Five of 18 immature griffons died during one year. Individuals that died had failed to migrate sufficiently far northward (>1500 km) in spring. Individuals likely died if they flew against headwinds from the north or were less able to find thermal updrafts. Surviving individuals migrated to cold and dry areas with low population density. We highlight flight experience, long distance movements, and remote places with low human population as factors critical for the survival of Himalayan vultures.

  {"id":"shnayder2004s-psicenss","abstract":"Developing sensor network applications demands a new set of tools to aid programmers. A number of simulation environments have been developed that provide varying degrees of scalability, realism, and detail for understanding the behavior of sensor networks. To date, however, none of these tools have addressed one of the most important aspects of sensor application design: that of power consumption. While simple approximations of overall power usage can be derived from estimates of node duty cycle and communication rates, these techniques often fail to capture the detailed, low-level energy requirements of the CPU, radio, sensors, and other peripherals. In this paper, we present PowerTOSSIM, a scalable simulation environment for wireless sensor networks that provides an accurate, per-node estimate of power consumption. PowerTOSSIM is an extension to TOSSIM, an event-driven simulation environment for TinyOS applications. In PowerTOSSIM, Tiny OS components corresponding to specific hardware peripherals (such as the radio, EEPROM, LEDs, and so forth) are instrumented to obtain a trace of each device's activity during the simulation run. PowerTOSSIM employs a novel code-transformation technique to estimate the number of CPU cycles executed by each node, eliminating the need for expensive instruction-level simulation of sensor nodes. PowerTOSSIM includes a detailed model of hardware energy consumption based on the Mica2 sensor node platform. Through instrumentation of actual sensor nodes, we demonstrate that PowerTOSSIM provides accurate estimation of power consumption for a range of applications and scales to support very large simulations.

  {"id":"signer2010mee","abstract":"1. Measuring physiological and behavioural parameters in free-ranging animals - and therefore under fully natural conditions - is of general biological concern but difficult to perform.2. We have developed a minimally invasive telemetry system for ruminants that is capable of measuring heart rate (HR), body temperature (T(b)) and locomotor activity (LA). A ruminal transmitter unit was per os placed into the reticulum and therefore located in close proximity to the heart. The unit detected HR by the use of an acceleration sensor and also measured T(b). HR and T(b) signals were transmitted via short-distance UHF link to a repeater system located in a collar unit. The collar unit decoded and processed signals received from the ruminal unit, measured LA with two different activity sensors and transmitted pulse interval-modulated VHF signals over distances of up to 10 km.3. HR data measured with the new device contained noise caused by reticulum contractions and animal movements that triggered the acceleration sensor in the ruminal unit. We have developed a software filter to remove this noise. Hence, the system was only capable of measuring HR in animals that showed little or no activity and in the absence of rumen contractions. Reliability of this 'stationary HR' measurement was confirmed with a second independent measurement of HR detected by an electrocardiogram in a domestic sheep (Ovis aries).4. In addition, we developed an algorithm to correctly classify an animal as 'active' or 'at rest' during each 3-min interval from the output of the activity sensors. Comparison with direct behavioural observations on free-ranging Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) showed that 87% of intervals were classified correctly.5. First results from applications of this new technique in free-ranging Alpine ibex underlined its suitability for reliable and long-term monitoring of physiological and behavioural parameters in ruminants under harsh field conditions. With the battery settings and measurement cycles used in this study, we achieved a system lifetime of approximately 2 years.","author":[{"family":"Signer","given":"Claudio"},{"family":"Ruf","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Schober","given":"Franz"},{"family":"Fluch","given":"Gerhard"},{"family":"Paumann","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Arnold","given":"Walter"}],"citation-key":"signer2010mee","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/j.2041-210x.2009.00010.x","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,3]]},"page":"75-85","title":"A versatile telemetry system for continuous measurement of heart rate, body temperature and locomotor activity in free-ranging ruminants","type":"article-journal","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"silva2014po","abstract":"Argos recently implemented a new algorithm to calculate locations of satellite-tracked animals that uses a Kalman filter (KF). The KF algorithm is reported to increase the number and accuracy of estimated positions over the traditional Least Squares (LS) algorithm, with potential advantages to the application of state-space methods to model animal movement data. We tested the performance of two Bayesian state-space models (SSMs) fitted to satellite tracking data processed with KF algorithm. Tracks from 7 harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) tagged with ARGOS satellite transmitters equipped with Fastloc GPS loggers were used to calculate the error of locations estimated from SSMs fitted to KF and LS data, by comparing those to \"true\" GPS locations. Data on 6 fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) were used to investigate consistency in movement parameters, location and behavioural states estimated by switching state-space models (SSSM) fitted to data derived from KF and LS methods. The model fit to KF locations improved the accuracy of seal trips by 27% over the LS model. 82% of locations predicted from the KF model and 73% of locations from the LS model were <5 km from the corresponding interpolated GPS position. Uncertainty in KF model estimates (5.6±5.6 km) was nearly half that of LS estimates (11.6±8.4 km). Accuracy of KF and LS modelled locations was sensitive to precision but not to observation frequency or temporal resolution of raw Argos data. On average, 88% of whale locations estimated by KF models fell within the 95% probability ellipse of paired locations from LS models. Precision of KF locations for whales was generally higher. Whales' behavioural mode inferred by KF models matched the classification from LS models in 94% of the cases. State-space models fit to KF data can improve spatial accuracy of location estimates over LS models and produce equally reliable behavioural estimates.","author":[{"family":"Silva","given":"Mónica A"},{"family":"Jonsen","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Russell","given":"Deborah J.F."},{"family":"Prieto","given":"Rui"},{"family":"Thompson","given":"Dave"},{"family":"Baumgartner","given":"Mark F."}],"citation-key":"silva2014po","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0092277","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"page":"92277-92277","title":"Assessing performance of Bayesian state-space models fit to argos satellite telemetry locations processed with kalman filtering","type":"article-journal","URL":"www.plosone.org","volume":"9"},

Buntings on 13 L in both temperature groups showed complete growth-regression cycles in body fattening, Zugunruhe and testis maturation. In birds on 13 L, high temperature attenuated activity levels, delayed onset of Zugunruhe by about 12 days, reduced body fattening and slowed testicular maturation. The effect of temperature seems to be on the rate of photoperiodic induction rather than on the critical day length. It is suggested that a change in temperature could alter the timing of the development of phenologies linked with seasonal migration and reproduction in migratory songbirds. © 2011 The Royal Society.","author":[{"family":"Singh","given":"Jyoti"},{"family":"Budki","given":"Puja"},{"family":"Rani","given":"Sangeeta"},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Vinod"}],"citation-key":"singh2012prsbbs","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2011.1062","issue":"1728","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"page":"509-515","title":"Temperature alters the photoperiodically controlled phenologies linked with migration and reproduction in a night-migratory songbird","type":"article-journal","volume":"279"},
  {"id":"sjoberg2018jab","abstract":"Recent advances in tracking technology are based on the use of miniature sensors for recording new aspects of individual migratory behaviour. In this study, we have used activity data loggers with barometric and temperature sensors to record the flight altitudes as well as ground elevations during stationary periods of migratory songbirds. We tracked one individual of red-backed shrike and one great reed warbler along their autumn migration from Europe to Africa. Both individuals performed their migration stepwise in travel segments and climbed most metres during the passage across the Mediterranean Sea and the Sahara Desert and least metres during the first flight segment in Europe. The great reed warbler reached its highest flight altitude of 3950 m a.s.l. during the travel segment from Europe to west Africa, while the red-backed shrike reached 3650 m a.s.l as maximum flight altitude during its travel segment from Sahel to southern Africa. Both individuals used both lowlands and highlands for resting periods along their migrations. Furthermore, temperature decreased with increasing altitude during migratory flights for both individuals, highlighting the potential to determine flight duration from temperature measurements. Finally, we discuss how barometric data could be used to investigate birds? responses to changes in air pressure as a cue for departures on migratory flights. This new technique, i.e. using a miniature data logger with barometric pressure sensor to estimate flight altitudes and ground elevations, will open up new avenues for research and importantly advance our understanding on how small birds behave during migratory flights.","author":[{"family":"Sjöberg","given":"Sissel"},{"family":"Pedersen","given":"Lykke"},{"family":"Malmiga","given":"Gintaras"},{"family":"Alerstam","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Hansson","given":"Bengt"},{"family":"Hasselquist","given":"Dennis"},{"family":"Thorup","given":"Kasper"},{"family":"Tøttrup","given":"Anders P"},{"family":"Andersson","given":"Arne"},{"family":"Bäckman","given":"Johan"}],"citation-key":"sjoberg2018jab","container-title":"Journal of Avian Biology","DOI":"10.1111/jav.01821","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9]]},"page":"e01821-e01821","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","title":"Barometer logging reveals new dimensions of individual songbird migration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jav.01821","volume":"49"},

  {"id":"slowinski2018po","abstract":"Long-distance migrations influence the physiology, behavior, and fitness of migratory animals throughout their annual cycles, and fundamentally alter their interactions with parasites. Several hypotheses relating migratory behavior to the likelihood of parasitism have entered the literature, making conflicting, testable predictions. To assess how migratory behavior of hosts is associated with parasitism, we compared haemosporidian parasite infections between two closely related populations of a common North American sparrow, the dark-eyed junco, that co-occur in shared habitats during the non-breeding season. One population is sedentary and winters and breeds in the Appalachian Mountains. The other population is migratory and is found in seasonal sympatry with the sedentary population from October through April, but then flies (≥ 900 km) northwards to breed. The populations were sampled in the wild on the shared montane habitat at the beginning of winter and again after confining them in a captive common environment until the spring. We found significantly higher prevalence of haemosporidian parasite infections in the sedentary population. Among infected juncos, we found no difference in parasite densities (parasitemias) between the sedentary and migrant populations and no evidence for winter dormancy of the parasites. Our results suggest that long-distance migration may reduce the prevalence of parasite infections at the population level. Our results are inconsistent with the migratory exposure hypothesis, which posits that long-distance migration increases exposure of hosts to diverse parasites, and with the migratory susceptibility hypothesis, which posits that trade-offs between immune function and migration increase host susceptibility to parasites. However, our results are consistent with the migratory culling hypothesis, which posits that heavily infected animals are less likely to survive long-distance migration, and with the migratory escape hypothesis, which posits that long-distance migration allows host populations to seasonally escape areas of high infection risk.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Slowinski","given":"Samuel P."},{"family":"Fudickar","given":"Adam M."},{"family":"Hughes","given":"Alex M."},{"family":"Mettler","given":"Raeann D."},{"family":"Gorbatenko","given":"Oxana V."},{"family":"Spellman","given":"Garth M."},{"family":"Ketterson","given":"Ellen D."},{"family":"Atwell","given":"Jonathan W."}],"citation-key":"slowinski2018po","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0201563","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,22]]},"language":"en","page":"e0201563","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Sedentary songbirds maintain higher prevalence of haemosporidian parasite infections than migratory conspecifics during seasonal sympatry","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201563","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"spivey2013jotrsi","abstract":"An idealized energy fluctuation model of a bird's body undergoing horizontal flapping flight is developed, focusing on the biomechanical power discernible to a body-mounted accelerometer. Expressions for flight body power constructed from root mean square dynamic body accelerations and wingstroke frequency are derived from first principles and presented in dimensionally appropriate units. As wingstroke frequency increases, the model generally predicts a gradual transition in power from a linear to an asymptotically cubic relationship. However, the onset of this transition and the degree to which this occurs depends upon whether and how forward vibrations are exploited for temporary energy storage and retrieval. While this may vary considerably between species and individual birds, it is found that a quadrature phase arrangement is generally advantageous during level flight. Gravity-aligned vertical acceleration always enters into the calculation of body power, but, whenever forward acceleration becomes relevant, its contribution is subtractive. Several novel kinematic measures descriptive of flapping flight are postulated, offering fresh insights into the processes involved in airborne locomotion. The limitations of the model are briefly discussed, and departures from its predictions during ascending and descending flight evaluated. These findings highlight how body-mounted accelerometers can offer a valuable, insightful and non-invasive technique for investigating the flight of free-ranging birds and bats.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Spivey","given":"R.

  {"id":"spoelstra2018pbs","abstract":"Artificial light at night has shown a dramatic increase over the last decades and continues to increase. Light at night can have strong effects on the behaviour and physiology of species, which includes changes in the daily timing of activity; a clear example is the advance in dawn song onset in songbirds by low levels of light at night. Although such effects are often referred to as changes in circadian timing, i.e. changes to the internal clock, two alternative mechanisms are possible. First, light at night can change the timing of clock controlled activity, without any change to the clock itself; e.g. by a change in the phase relation between the circadian clock and expression of activity. Second, changes in daily activity can be a direct response to light (‘masking’), without any involvement of the circadian system. Here, we studied whether the advance in onset of activity by dim light at night in great tits (Parus major) is indeed attributable to a phase shift of the internal clock. We entrained birds to a normal light/dark (LD) cycle with bright light during daytime and darkness at night, and to a comparable (LDim) schedule with dim light at night. The dim light at night strongly advanced the onset of activity of the birds. After at least six days in LD or LDim, we kept birds in constant darkness (DD) by leaving off all lights so birds would revert to their endogenous, circadian system controlled timing of activity. We found that the timing of onset in DD was not dependent on whether the birds were kept at LD or LDim before the measurement. Thus, the advance of activity under light at night is caused by a direct effect of light rather than a phase shift of the internal clock. This demonstrates that birds are capable of changing their daily activity to low levels of light at night directly, without the need to alter their internal clock.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Spoelstra","given":"Kamiel"},{"family":"Verhagen","given":"Irene"},{"family":"Meijer","given":"Davy"},{"family":"Visser","given":"Marcel E."}],"citation-key":"spoelstra2018pbs","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc Biol Sci","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2017.2751","ISSN":"0962-8452","issue":"1875","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,28]]},"page":"20172751","PMCID":"PMC5897635","PMID":"29593108","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Artificial light at night shifts daily activity patterns but not the internal clock in the great tit (Parus major)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5897635/","volume":"285"},

  {"id":"stenseth2015prsbbs","abstract":"Climate change is expected to have profound ecological effects, yet shifts in competitive abilities among species are rarely studied in this context. Blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) and great tits (Parus major) compete for food and roosting sites, yet coexist across much of their range. Climate change might thus change the competitive relationships and coexistence between these two species. Analysing four of the highest-quality, long-term datasets available on these species across Europe, we extend the textbook example of coexistence between competing species to include the dynamic effects of long-term climate variation. Using threshold time-series statistical modelling, we demonstrate that long-term climate variation affects species demography through different influences on density-dependent and density-independent processes. The competitive interaction between blue tits and great tits has shifted in one of the studied sites, creating conditions that alter the relative equilibrium densities between the two species, potentially disrupting longterm coexistence. Our analyses show that long-term climate change can, but does not always, generate local differences in the equilibrium conditions of spatially structured species assemblages. We demonstrate how long-term data can be used to better understand whether (and how), for instance, climate change might change the relationships between coexisting species. However, the studied populations are rather robust against competitive exclusion.","author":[{"family":"Stenseth","given":"Nils Chr"},{"family":"Durant","given":"Joël M"},{"family":"Fowler","given":"Mike S."},{"family":"Matthysen","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Adriaensen","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Jonzén","given":"Niclas"},{"family":"Chan","given":"Kung Sik"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Hai"},{"family":"De Laet","given":"Jenny"},{"family":"Sheldon","given":"Ben C."},{"family":"Visser","given":"Marcel E."},{"family":"Dhondt","given":"André A."}],"citation-key":"stenseth2015prsbbs","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2014.1958","issue":"1807","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"title":"Testing for effects of climate change on competitive relationships and coexistence between two bird species","type":"article-journal","volume":"282"},

To do this, we have developed a biologging device that can record the primary sensory information and the associated movements during foraging and navigating in echolocating bats. This 2.6-g tag records the sonar calls and echoes from an ultrasonic microphone, while simultaneously sampling fine-scale movement in three dimensions from wideband accelerometers and magnetometers. In this study, we tested the tag on an European noctula Nyctalus noctula during target approaches and on four big brown bats Eptesicus fuscus during prey interception in a flight room. We show that the tag records both the outgoing calls and echoes returning from objects at biologically relevant distances. Inertial sensor data enables the detection of behavioural events such as flying, turning, and resting. In addition, individual wing-beats can be tracked and synchronized to the bat's sound emissions to study the coordination of different motor events. By recording the primary acoustic flow of bats concomitant with associated behaviours on a very fine time-scale, this type of biologging method will foster a deeper understanding of how sensory inputs guide feeding behaviours in the wild.","author":[{"family":"Stidsholt","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Beedholm","given":"Kristian"},{"family":"Jakobsen","given":"Lasse"},{"family":"Kugler","given":"Kathrin"},{"family":"Brinkløv","given":"Signe"},{"family":"Salles","given":"Angeles"},{"family":"Moss","given":"Cynthia F"},{"family":"Madsen","given":"Peter Teglberg"}],"citation-key":"stidsholt2019mee","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.13108","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"page":"48-58","title":"A 2.6-g sound and movement tag for studying the acoustic scene and kinematics of echolocating bats","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.13108","volume":"10"},

Two different formulations of dynamic body acceleration, [vectorial and overall DBA (VeDBA and ODBA)], correlated with mass-specific energy expenditure (both R2=0.91). VeDBA models combining and separately parameterizing flying, diving, activity on land and surface swimming were consistently considered more parsimonious than time budget models and showed less variability in model fit. Additionally, we observed evidence for the presence of hypometabolic processes (i.e. reduced heart rate and body temperature; shunting of blood away from non-essential organs) that suppressed metabolism in cormorants while diving, which was the most metabolically important activity.

In addition, a few animals are able to distinguish among different inclination angles and, in effect, exploit inclination as a surrogate for latitude. Little is known, however, about the role that magnetic inclination plays in guiding long-distance migrations. In this paper, we use an agent-based modelling approach to investigate whether an artificial agent can successfully execute a series of transequatorial migrations by using sequential measurements of magnetic inclination. The agent was tested with multiple navigation strategies in both present-day and reversed magnetic fields. The findings (i) demonstrate that sequential inclination measurements can enable migrations between the northern and southern hemispheres, and (ii) demonstrate that an inclination-based strategy can tolerate a reversed magnetic field, which could be useful in the development of autonomous engineered systems that must be robust to magnetic field changes. The findings also appear to be consistent with the results of some animal navigation experiments, although whether any animal exploits a strategy of using sequential measurements of inclination remains unknown.","author":[{"family":"Taylor","given":"Brian K"},{"family":"Lohmann","given":"Kenneth J"},{"family":"Havens","given":"Luke T"},{"family":"Lohmann","given":"Catherine M F"},{"family":"Granger","given":"Jesse"}],"citation-key":"taylor2021jrsi","container-title":"Journal of The Royal Society Interface","DOI":"10.1098/rsif.2020.0887","issue":"174","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1]]},"page":"20200887-20200887","publisher":"Royal Society","title":"Long-distance transequatorial navigation using sequential measurements of magnetic inclination angle","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2020.0887","volume":"18"},

We propose a new pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR)-based navigation algorithm by using magnetic, angular rate, and gravity (MARG) sensors which are equipped in existing commercial smartphone. Our proposed navigation algorithm consists of step detection, stride length estimation, and heading estimation. To eliminate the gauge step errors of the random bouncing motions, we designed a reliable algorithm for step detection. We developed a BP neural network-based stride length estimation algorithm to apply to different users. In response to the challenge of magnetic disturbance, a quaternion-based extended Kalman filter (EKF) is introduced to determine the user's heading direction for each step. The performance of our proposed pedestrian navigation algorithm is verified by using a smartphone in providing accurate, reliable, and continuous location tracking services.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Tian","given":"Zengshan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yuan"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Mu"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yu"}],"citation-key":"tian2014ejoaisp","container-title":"EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing","container-title-short":"EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing","DOI":"10.1186/1687-6180-2014-65","ISSN":"1687-6180","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,5,10]]},"page":"65","source":"BioMed Central","title":"Pedestrian dead reckoning for MARG navigation using a smartphone","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1687-6180-2014-65","volume":"2014"},

  {"id":"tomotani2019mee","abstract":"The recent boost in bird migration studies following the development of various tracking devices raised awareness of how detrimental attaching devices can be for animals. Such effects can occur during migration, but also immediately post-release if the device impairs escape flight performance and, consequently, the bird's ability to evade predators. In this study, we investigated the effect of carrying a device on the escape flight speed and aerodynamic force production in a migratory passerine. We recorded upward-directed escape flights of 15 male blackcaps. Each individual was tested without a tag, and when equipped with three different leg-loop dummy tags with masses representing around 3%, 5%, and 7% of their body mass. The experiment was designed such that all individuals passed through all treatments in a randomized order. We found that two factors affected flight speed in roughly equal amounts: first, tagged escape flights had lower flight speeds compared to the control flights, irrespective of tag mass. Second, we found an effect of the total mass, that is, the sum of the masses of the individual bird and of the tag, with heavier birds being slower. In contrast, flight speed was not correlated with relative tag mass in percentage of body mass, the metric commonly used in ethical guidelines for tag attachment. Aerodynamic flight force production also depended on total mass, with heavier birds producing higher forces. But these flight forces did not differ between flights with or without a tag. We conclude that, when tagging birds, it is misleading to choose heavy individuals for tagging in order to minimize the tag mass as a percentage of body mass. This is particularly relevant in species for which body mass is not necessarily related to size, like migratory birds that accumulate large fat reserves. The lower escape speed in “tagged” flights could not be explained by differences in net flight force production, because these did not differ between flights with and without a tag. This suggests that the tag also affected pre-flight take-off dynamics, possibly due to a leg harness-induced reduction in leg push-off performance.","author":[{"family":"Tomotani","given":"Barbara M"},{"family":"Bil","given":"Wender"},{"family":"Jeugd","given":"Henk P","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Pieters","given":"Remco P.M."},{"family":"Muijres","given":"Florian T"}],"citation-key":"tomotani2019mee","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.13112","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"page":"70-79","title":"Carrying a logger reduces escape flight speed in a passerine bird, but relative logger mass may be a misleading measure of this flight performance detriment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.13112","volume":"10"},

In this paper we present a novel technique for this analysis, one based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM’s). We assume that the actual path of the fish is generated by a biased random walk. The HMM methodology produces, for each time step, the probability that the fish resides in each grid cell. Because there is no Monte Carlo step in our technique, we are able to estimate parameters within the likelihood framework. The method does not require the distribution to be Gaussian or belong to any other of the usual families of distributions and can thus address constraints from shorelines and other nonlinear effects; the method can and does produce bimodal distributions. We discuss merits and limitations of the method, and perspectives for the more general problem of inference in state-space models of animals. The technique can be applied to geolocation based on light, on tidal patterns, or measurement of other variables that vary with space. We illustrate the method through application to a simulated data set where geolocation relies on depth data exclusively.","author":[{"family":"U.H.","given":"Thygesen"},{"family":"M.W.","given":"Pedersen"},{"family":"H.","given":"Madsen"}],"citation-key":"u.h.2009tatomawed","container-title":"Tagging and Tracking of Marine Animals with Electronic Devices","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"page":"277-293","title":"Geolocating Fish Using Hidden Markov Models and Data Storage Tags","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"valenti2015s","abstract":"Orientation estimation using low cost sensors is an important task for Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) in order to obtain a good feedback for the attitude controller. The challenges come from the low accuracy and noisy data of the MicroElectroMechanical System (MEMS) technology, which is the basis of modern, miniaturized inertial sensors. In this article, we describe a novel approach to obtain an estimation of the orientation in quaternion form from the observations of gravity and magnetic field. Our approach provides a quaternion estimation as the algebraic solution of a system from inertial/magnetic observations. We separate the problems of finding the “tilt” quaternion and the heading quaternion in two sub-parts of our system. This procedure is the key for avoiding the impact of the magnetic disturbances on the roll and pitch components of the orientation when the sensor is surrounded by unwanted magnetic flux. We demonstrate the validity of our method first analytically and then empirically using simulated data. We propose a novel complementary filter for MAVs that fuses together gyroscope data with accelerometer and magnetic field readings. The correction part of the filter is based on the method described above and works for both IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and MARG (Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity) sensors. We evaluate the effectiveness of the filter and show that it significantly outperforms other common methods, using publicly available datasets with ground-truth data recorded during a real flight experiment of a micro quadrotor helicopter.","author":[{"family":"Valenti","given":"Roberto G"},{"family":"Dryanovski","given":"Ivan"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Jizhong"}],"citation-key":"valenti2015s","container-title":"Sensors","DOI":"10.3390/s150819302","ISSN":"1424-8220","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"title":"Keeping a Good Attitude: A Quaternion-Based Orientation Filter for IMUs and MARGs","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},

Tail-mounted GPS-fitted birds showed significantly higher cumulative numbers of flap-glide cycles and a higher pitch angle of the tail than accelerometer- equipped birds, indicating problems with balancing inappropriately placed weights with knock-on consequences relating to energy expenditure.

Accelerometry is known to estimate energy expenditure through body movement in terrestrial animals, once calibrated using a treadmill with chamber respirometry. The flight equivalent, a wind tunnel with mask respirometry, is particularly difficult to instigate, and has not been applied to calibrate accelerometry. We take the first steps in exploring a novel method for calibrating accelerometers with flight energy expenditure. We collected accelerometry data for Harris's Hawks Parabuteo unicinctus flying to varying heights up to 4.1 m over a small horizontal distance; the mechanical energy expended to gain height can be estimated from physical first principles. The relationship between accelerometry and mechanical energy expenditure was strong, and while a simple wing flapping model confirmed that accelerometry is sensitive to both changes in wing beat amplitude and frequency, the relationship was explained predominately by changes in wing beat frequency, and less so by changes in amplitude. Our study provides initial, positive evidence that accelerometry can be calibrated with body power using climbing flights, potentially providing a basis for estimating flapping flight metabolic rate at least in situations of altitude gain.","author":[{"family":"Van Walsum","given":"Tessa A."},{"family":"Perna","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Bishop","given":"Charles M."},{"family":"Murn","given":"Campbell P."},{"family":"Collins","given":"Philip M"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Rory P."},{"family":"Halsey","given":"Lewis G."}],"citation-key":"vanwalsum2020i","container-title":"Ibis","DOI":"10.1111/ibi.12710","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"page":"13-26","title":"Exploring the relationship between flapping behaviour and accelerometer signal during ascending flight, and a new approach to calibration","type":"article-journal","volume":"162"},

A maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is formulated to iteratively find the optimal calibration parameters that best fit to the onboard sensor readings, without requiring external attitude references. It is shown that the proposed calibration technique is equivalent to the estimation of a rotation, scaling and translation transformation, and that the sensor alignment matrix is given by the solution of the orthogonal Procrustes problem.

Evolutionary ecologists study variation in seasonal timing and its fitness consequences, whereas chronobiologists emphasize the periodic nature of life-cycle stages and their underlying timing programmes (e.g. circannual rhythms). The (neuro-) endocrine processes underlying these life-cycle events are studied by physi-ologists and need to be linked to genes that are explored by molecular geneticists. In order to fully understand variation in phenology, we need to integrate these different perspectives, in particular by combining evolutionary and mechanistic approaches. We use avian research to characterize different perspectives and to highlight integration that has already been achieved.

Whereas we understand much about how environmental cues are used to time reproduction, we know relatively little about variation among individuals in responsiveness to environmental cues. However, this variation among individuals may represent a crucial component of a population's capacity to respond to changing environmental conditions. In this study, we quantify variation among individuals in photoperiod responsiveness of the avian reproductive system and investigate three potential underlying sources of this variation in environmental cue responsiveness. Specifically, we tested whether age-related photoperiodic experience, strength of the photoperiodic cue (day length), and degree of flexibility in breeding schedule influenced the degree of variation observed in experimental studies of seven species of cardueline finches. Overall, we found a high degree of variation among individuals in photoperiod response, and this was influenced by experimental photoperiod and breeding schedule. As experimental photoperiod became longer, the degree of variation declined. Opportunistic breeders showed greater variation in response compared with more seasonal breeders. We found no effect of age-related photoperiodic experience in one species for which we could examine this factor. The results of this study highlight the extent to which individuals can vary in their response to environmental cues and point to both species ecology and characteristics of the cue as important influences on the degree of this variation.","author":[{"family":"Watts","given":"Heather E"},{"family":"Macdougall-Shackleton","given":"Scott A."},{"family":"Hahn","given":"Thomas P."}],"citation-key":"watts2015jezpegp","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Zoology Part A: Ecological Genetics and Physiology","DOI":"10.1002/jez.1929","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"page":"368-374","title":"Variation among individuals in photoperiod responses: Effects of breeding schedule, photoperiod, and age-related photoperiodic experience in birds","type":"article-journal","volume":"323"},

Because the act of migration makes it difficult to follow individuals and populations year round, our understanding of the ecology and evolution of migrating organisms, particularly birds, has been severely impeded. Exciting new advances in satellite telemetry, genetic analyses and stable isotope chemistry are now making it possible to determine the population and geographical origin of individual birds.

  {"id":"whitford2019ab","abstract":"Background: The ability to remotely monitor the behavior of animals and their interactions with their environment has revolutionized how ecologists conduct studies. The creative use and placement of sensors on both biologging and biotelemetric platforms can greatly expand the amount of information that can be garnered from ecological studies. Results: Sophisticated transmitters and data loggers, which once were built by the biologists that used them, are available off the shelf from many commercial manufacturers. The ability to purchase a wide variety of electronic tags has allowed for a wider adoption of electronic tags across ecology, but has resulted in many biologists utilizing them with little understanding of how they function. The purpose of this review is to provide a reader-friendly description of the many sensors available to monitor the behavior, physiology, and environment of both terrestrial and aquatic animals. Our approach here is firstly to describe the electrical and mechanical principles behind each type of sensor and secondly to present one or two classic examples of how they have been used to provide insights into the biology of species from a diversity of taxa. Behavioral sensors that record the speed, acceleration, tilt angle, and direction of movement of an animal as well as its swimming depth or flight altitude will be described. Additional sensors are mentioned that detect feeding and spawning behavior as well as the proximity to conspecifics, prey, and predators. Physiological sensors will be described that monitor muscular, sensory, brain, gastric activity as well as body temperature, and sound production. Environmental sensors will be described that measure irradiance, dissolved oxygen, and magnetic field intensity. It is our hope that this review serves as springboard for biologists to develop innovative ways to learn more about their subjects using the myriad sensors that are available today, and the exciting new sensors to be developed in the future.","author":[{"family":"Whitford","given":"Malachi"},{"family":"Klimley","given":"A Peter"}],"citation-key":"whitford2019ab","container-title":"Animal Biotelemetry","DOI":"10.1186/s40317-019-0189-z","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"title":"An overview of behavioral, physiological, and environmental sensors used in animal biotelemetry and biologging studies","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"williams2015ab","abstract":"Accelerometry has been used to identify behaviours through the quantification of body posture and motion for a range of species moving in different media. This technique has not been applied to flight behaviours to the same degree, having only been used to distinguish flapping from soaring flight, even though identifying the type of soaring flight could provide important insights into the factors underlying movement paths in soaring birds. This may be due to the complexities of interpreting acceleration data, as movement in the aerial environment may be influenced by phenomena such as centripetal acceleration (pulling-g). This study used high-resolution movement data on the flight of free-living Andean condors (Vultur gryphus) and a captive Eurasian griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) to examine the influence of gravitational, dynamic and centripetal acceleration in different flight types. Flight behaviour was categorised as thermal soaring, slope soaring, gliding and flapping, using changes in altitude and heading from magnetometry data. We examined the ability of the k-nearest neighbour (KNN) algorithm to distinguish between these behaviours using acceleration data alone.","author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"H.

Another sensor commonly used in animal-attached loggers is the magnetometer, which has been primarily used in dead-reckoning or inertial measurement tags, but little outside that. We examine the potential of magnetometers for helping elucidate the behaviour of animals in a manner analogous to, but very different from, accelerometers. The particular responses of magnetometers to movement means that there are instances when they can resolve behaviours that are not easily perceived using accelerometers.","author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"Hannah J"},{"family":"Holton","given":"Mark D"},{"family":"Shepard","given":"Emily L C"},{"family":"Largey","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Norman","given":"Brad"},{"family":"Ryan","given":"Peter G"},{"family":"Duriez","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Scantlebury","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Quintana","given":"Flavio"},{"family":"Magowan","given":"Elizabeth A"},{"family":"Marks","given":"Nikki J"},{"family":"Alagaili","given":"Abdulaziz N"},{"family":"Bennett","given":"Nigel C"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Rory P"}],"citation-key":"williams2017me","container-title":"Movement Ecology","DOI":"10.1186/s40462-017-0097-x","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"page":"6-6","title":"Identification of animal movement patterns using tri-axial magnetometry","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40462-017-0097-x","volume":"5"},
  {"id":"williams2020jae","abstract":"The paradigm-changing opportunities of biologging sensors for ecological research, especially movement ecology, are vast, but the crucial questions of how best to match the most appropriate sensors and sensor combinations to specific biological questions and how to analyse complex biologging data, are mostly ignored. Here, we fill this gap by reviewing how to optimize the use of biologging techniques to answer questions in movement ecology and synthesize this into an Integrated Biologging Framework (IBF). We highlight that multisensor approaches are a new frontier in biologging, while identifying current limitations and avenues for future development in sensor technology. We focus on the importance of efficient data exploration, and more advanced multidimensional visualization methods, combined with appropriate archiving and sharing approaches, to tackle the big data issues presented by biologging. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities in matching the peculiarities of specific sensor data to the statistical models used, highlighting at the same time the large advances which will be required in the latter to properly analyse biologging data. Taking advantage of the biologging revolution will require a large improvement in the theoretical and mathematical foundations of movement ecology, to include the rich set of high-frequency multivariate data, which greatly expand the fundamentally limited and coarse data that could be collected using location-only technology such as GPS. Equally important will be the establishment of multidisciplinary collaborations to catalyse the opportunities offered by current and future biologging technology. If this is achieved, clear potential exists for developing a vastly improved mechanistic understanding of animal movements and their roles in ecological processes and for building realistic predictive models.","author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"Hannah J"},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Lucy A"},{"family":"Benhamou","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Bijleveld","given":"Allert I"},{"family":"Clay","given":"Thomas A"},{"family":"Grissac","given":"Sophie","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Demšar","given":"Urška"},{"family":"English","given":"Holly M"},{"family":"Franconi","given":"Novella"},{"family":"Gómez-Laich","given":"Agustina"},{"family":"Griffiths","given":"Rachael C"},{"family":"Kay","given":"William P"},{"family":"Morales","given":"Juan Manuel"},{"family":"Potts","given":"Jonathan R"},{"family":"Rogerson","given":"Katharine F"},{"family":"Rutz","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Spelt","given":"Anouk"},{"family":"Trevail","given":"Alice M"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Rory P"},{"family":"Börger","given":"Luca"}],"citation-key":"williams2020jae","container-title":"Journal of Animal Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2656.13094","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"page":"186-206","title":"Optimizing the use of biologgers for movement ecology research","type":"article-journal","volume":"89"},
  {"id":"williams2020p","abstract":"Flight costs are predicted to vary with environmental conditions, and this should ultimately determine the movement capacity and distributions of large soaring birds. Despite this, little is known about how flight effort varies with environmental parameters. We deployed bio-logging devices on the world’s heaviest soaring bird, the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus), to assess the extent to which these birds can operate without resorting to powered flight. Our records of individual wingbeats in >216 h of flight show that condors can sustain soaring across a wide range of wind and thermal conditions, flapping for only 1% of their flight time. This is among the very lowest estimated movement costs in vertebrates. One bird even flew for >5 h without flapping, covering ∼172 km. Overall, > 75% of flapping flight was associated with takeoffs. Movement between weak thermal updrafts at the start of the day also imposed a metabolic cost, with birds flapping toward the end of glides to reach ephemeral thermal updrafts. Nonetheless, the investment required was still remarkably low, and even in winter conditions with weak thermals, condors are only predicted to flap for ∼2 s per kilometer. Therefore, the overall flight effort in the largest soaring birds appears to be constrained by the requirements for takeoff.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"H.

  {"id":"wilson2007fo","abstract":"Abstract Pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) are now widely used to document the geographic and vertical movements of large pelagic fishes. These instruments record measurements of ambient light, depth and temperature at regular intervals and the light data are used to compute daily estimates of latitude and longitude. Several methods have been developed to improve those estimates, including the application of Kalman filter models and matching sea surface temperatures (SST) from tags with remotely sensed SSTs. Despite their widespread use, few studies have evaluated the accuracy of raw estimates of location from PSATs or quantified the improvements that may result from refinement techniques. To assess the accuracy of raw and refined estimates of locations from PSATs, we attached two PSATs and one Argos satellite-linked transmitter (SAT tag) to one whale shark (Rhincodon typus) at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia. The root mean square error (RMSE) in raw estimates of location provided by the PSATs was 5.16° latitude and 2.00° longitude. Estimates were more accurate after processing the data with a Kalman filter (RMSE?=?2.97° latitude and 0.78° longitude) and most accurate after processing with a Kalman filter model that integrates SST measurements (RMSE?=?1.84° latitude and 0.78° longitude). We also assessed the precision of the PSAT-derived locations, and depth and temperature measurements by comparing the data from the two PSATs. Our findings support the use of archival tag data to reconstruct the large-scale movements of marine animals and demonstrate the significant improvements that may result from two refinement techniques.","author":[{"family":"WILSON","given":"S G"},{"family":"STEWART","given":"B S"},{"family":"POLOVINA","given":"J J"},{"family":"MEEKAN","given":"M G"},{"family":"STEVENS","given":"J D"},{"family":"GALUARDI","given":"B"}],"citation-key":"wilson2007fo","container-title":"Fisheries Oceanography","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2419.2007.00450.x","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,11]]},"page":"547-554","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","title":"Accuracy and precision of archival tag data: a multiple-tagging study conducted on a whale shark (Rhincodon typus) in the Indian Ocean","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2419.2007.00450.x","volume":"16"},

This is especially important as predictable changes of the environment (seasonality) are shifting rapidly as well as unpredictable changes (perturbations) in novel ways. What we need to know is how organisms perceive their environment, transduce that information into neuroendocrine signals that orchestrate morphological, physiological and behavioral responses.

  {"id":"wu2018itase","abstract":"As a key problem for multi-sensor attitude determination, Wahba’s problem has been studied for almost 50 years. Different from existing methods, this paper presents a novel linear approach to solving this problem. We name the proposed method the Fast Linear Attitude Estimator (FLAE) because it is faster than known representative algorithms. The original Wahba’s problem is extracted to several 1-dimensional equations based on quaternions. They are then investigated with pseudo-inverse matrices establishing a linear solution to ndimensional equations, which are equivalent to the conventional Wahba’s problem. To obtain the attitude quaternion in a robust manner, an eigenvalue-based solution is proposed. Symbolic solutions to the corresponding characteristic polynomial is derived showing higher computation speed. Simulations are designed and conducted using test cases evaluated by several classical methods e.g. M. D. Shuster’s QUaternion ESTimator (QUEST), F. L. Markley’s SVD method, D. Mortari’s Second Estimator of the Optimal Quaternion (ESOQ2) and some recent representative methods e.g. Y. Yang’s analytical method and Riemannian manifold method. The results show that FLAE generates attitude estimates as accurate as that of several existing methods but consumes much less computation time (about 50% of the known best algorithm). Also, to verify the feasibility in embedded application, an experiment on the accelerometer-magnetometer combination is carried out where the algorithms are compared via C++ programming language. An extreme case is ﬁnally studied, revealing a minor improvement shows more effectiveness in this case inspired by Y.

  {"id":"wynn2020cb","abstract":"In migratory animals for whom post-natal care is limited, it is essential that there are inherited mechanisms whereby an individual can navigate—first, to the terminus of their migration, and second, back to a suitable breeding site. In birds, empirical evidence suggests that orientation on first migration is controlled by an inherited navigational vector, a direction and a distance in which to move (the “clock and compass” model) [1–5]. The mechanism and information that underlie the return to the natal breeding site are, however, almost entirely unknown. A potential solution to this problem would be for an animal to learn the values for spatially and temporally stable gradient cues that specifically indicate the location of the natal site [6–16]. One potential cue for latitude is magnetic inclination. Here, we use ringing recoveries made over the last 80 years to investigate whether magnetic inclination might be used as a navigational cue to control the latitude of recruitment in a trans-global migrant, the Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus). We find that small changes in inclination between when a bird fledges and when it returns from first migration correlate with probabilistic changes in latitude at recruitment, in doing so quantitatively fulfilling a priori predictions as to the magnitude and direction of latitudinal shift. This, we believe, suggests that (1) natal magnetic inclination is learnt prior to fledging and (2) is used to provide latitudinal information when making the first return trip from the wintering grounds.","author":[{"family":"Wynn","given":"Joe"},{"family":"Padget","given":"Oliver"},{"family":"Mouritsen","given":"Henrik"},{"family":"Perrins","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Guilford","given":"Tim"}],"citation-key":"wynn2020cb","container-title":"Current Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.cub.2020.05.039","issue":"14","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7]]},"page":"2869-2873.e2","publisher":"Cell Press","title":"Natal imprinting to the Earth's magnetic field in a pelagic seabird","type":"article-journal","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"yun2008itim","abstract":"Orientation of a static or slow-moving rigid body can be determined from the measured gravity and local magnetic field vectors. Some formulation of the QUaternion ESTimator (QUEST) algorithm is commonly used to solve this problem. Triads of accelerometers and magnetometers are used to measure gravity and local magnetic field vectors in sensor coordinates. In the QUEST algorithm, local magnetic field measurements affect not only the estimation of yaw but also that of roll and pitch. Due to the deviations in the direction of the magnetic field vector between locations, it is not desirable to use magnetic data in calculations that are related to the determination of roll and pitch. This paper presents a geometrically intuitive 3-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) orientation estimation algorithm with physical meaning [which is called the factored quaternion algorithm (FQA)], which restricts the use of magnetic data to the determination of the rotation about the vertical axis. The algorithm produces a quaternion output to represent the orientation. Through a derivation based on half-angle formulas and due to the use of quaternions, the computational cost of evaluating trigonometric functions is avoided. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has an overall accuracy that is essentially identical to that of the QUEST algorithm and is computationally more efficient. Additionally, magnetic variations cause only azimuth errors in FQA attitude estimation. A singularity avoidance method is introduced, which allows the algorithm to track through all orientations.","author":[{"family":"Yun","given":"X"},{"family":"Bachmann","given":"E R"},{"family":"McGhee","given":"R B"}],"citation-key":"yun2008itim","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","DOI":"10.1109/TIM.2007.911646","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"page":"638-650","title":"A Simplified Quaternion-Based Algorithm for Orientation Estimation From Earth Gravity and Magnetic Field Measurements","type":"article-journal","volume":"57"},

  {"id":"zein2021me","abstract":"Background:  Different theories suggest birds may use compass or map navigational systems associated with Earth’s magnetic intensity or inclination, especially during migratory flights. These theories have only been tested by considering properties of the Earth’s magnetic field at coarse temporal scales, typically ignoring the temporal dynamics of geomagnetic values that may affect migratory navigational capacity. Methods:  We designed a simulation experiment to study if and how birds use the geomagnetic field during migration by using both high resolution GPS tracking data and geomagnetic data at relatively fine spatial and temporal resolutions in comparison to previous studies. Our simulations use correlated random walks (CRW) and correlated random bridge (CRB) models to model different navigational strategies based on underlying dynamic geomagnetic data. We translated navigational strategies associated with geomagnetic cues into probability surfaces that are included in the random walk models. Simulated trajectories from these models were compared to the actual GPS trajectories of migratory birds using 3 different similarity measurements to evaluate which of the strategies was most likely to have occurred. Results and conclusion:  We designed a simulation experiment which can be applied to different wildlife species under varying conditions worldwide. In the case of our example species, we found that a compass-type strategy based on taxis, defined as movement towards an extreme value, produced the closest and most similar trajectories when compared to original GPS tracking data in CRW models. Our results indicate less evidence for map navigation (constant heading and bi-gradient taxis navigation). Additionally, our results indicate a multifactorial navigational mechanism necessitating more than one cue for successful navigation to the target. This is apparent from our simulations because the modelled endpoints of the trajectories of the CRW models do not reach close proximity to the target location of the GPS trajectory when simulated with geomagnetic navigational strategies alone. Additionally, the magnitude of the effect of the geomagnetic cues during navigation in our models was low in our CRB models. More research on the scale effects of the geomagnetic field on navigation, along with temporally varying geomagnetic data could be useful for further improving future models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Zein","given":"Beate"},{"family":"Long","given":"Jed A."},{"family":"Safi","given":"Kamran"},{"family":"Kölzsch","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Wikelski","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Kruckenberg","given":"Helmut"},{"family":"Demšar","given":"Urška"}],"citation-key":"zein2021me","container-title":"Movement Ecology","container-title-short":"Mov Ecol","DOI":"10.1186/s40462-021-00283-5","ISSN":"2051-3933","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,12]]},"language":"en","page":"46","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Simulation experiment to test strategies of geomagnetic navigation during long-distance bird migration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://movementecologyjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40462-021-00283-5","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"zhang2015itie","abstract":"Low-cost inertial/magnetic sensor units have been extensively used to determine sensor attitude information for a wide variety of applications, ranging from virtual reality, underwater vehicles, handheld navigation systems, to biomotion analysis and biomedical applications. In order to achieve precise attitude reconstruction, appropriate sensor calibration procedures must be performed in advance to process sensor readings properly. In this paper, we are aiming to calibrate different error parameters, such as sensor sensitivity/scale factor error, offset/bias error, nonorthogonality error, mounting error, and also soft iron and hard iron errors for magnetometers. Instead of estimating all of these parameters individually, these errors are combined together as the combined bias and transformation matrix. Two-step approaches are proposed to determine the combined bias and transformation matrix separately. For the accelerometer and magnetometer, the combined bias is determined by finding an optimal ellipsoid that can best fit the sensor readings, and the transformation matrix is then derived through a two-step iterative algorithm by exploring the intrinsic relationship among sensor readings. For the gyroscope, the combined bias can be easily determined by placing the sensor node stationary. For the transformation matrix estimation, the intrinsic relationship among gyroscope readings is explored again, and an unscented Kalman filter is employed to determine such matrix. The calibration methods are then applied to our sensor nodes, and the good performance of the orientation estimation has illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed sensor calibration methods.","author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Z"}],"citation-key":"zhang2015itie","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","DOI":"10.1109/TIE.2014.2375258","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"page":"3714-3723","title":"Two-Step Calibration Methods for Miniature Inertial and Magnetic Sensor Units","type":"article-journal","volume":"62"},
  {"id":"zhao2014itgrs","abstract":"Plenty of evidence has implied that animals like pigeons and sea turtles utilize geomagnetic information for long-distance migration and homing. In this paper, we conduct an ab initio investigation to imitate a migratory animal's geomagnetic homing across a long distance over the surface of the Earth. Based on a simple assumption that such animals have a natural ability to sense and compare the included angle between the vector geomagnetic field (GF) and a specific geographic direction such as the due north, we show that a long-distance geomagnetic navigation (GN) can be accomplished without any assistance of prestored geomagnetic and geographic information, as long as the navigation is inside a vast area where such a spatial angle can uniquely determine a geographic location. Without any requirement of measuring the strength of the GF, this GN will not be visibly affected by the recurrent fluctuation of the GF that severely hampers traditional GN. By introducing the extended-Kalman-filter algorithm, it is able to find a shortcut in the geomagnetic space, overcoming interferences of strong Gaussian and local-area geomagnetic anomaly. We believe that the proposed approach will find a wide range of potential applications in global, local, and indoor navigations based on magnetic field in the future.","author":[{"family":"Zhao","given":"Z"},{"family":"Hu","given":"T"},{"family":"Cui","given":"W"},{"family":"Huangfu","given":"J"},{"family":"Li","given":"C"},{"family":"Ran","given":"L"}],"citation-key":"zhao2014itgrs","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.1109/TGRS.2014.2301441","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"page":"6715-6723","title":"Long-Distance Geomagnetic Navigation: Imitations of Animal Migration Based on a New Assumption","type":"article-journal","volume":"52"},
