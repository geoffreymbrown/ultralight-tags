# Tools and Supplies 

A variety of tools and supplies are needed to 

1. Prepare tags for flight
2. Assemble tags
3. Assembly bases and chargers

# Preparing Tags For Flight

For a guide to preparing tags for flight see [section].  This guide, by Jiawei Chen and Tim Greives, while written for the BitTag, applies to other tags as well.

Assuming that the tags are fully assembled, the only supplies and tools required are

**3mm Kapton (polymide) Tape**:  Kapton tape is widely use for insulation on electronics and holds up well under challenging conditions.  For tag flight preparation, a rectangle 3mm by 4mm is ideal for covering the test points on a tag used by the base and chargers for communication.

<img src="/docs/userguides/fabrication/tools/images/ceramic.png#floatright" alt="ceramic tweezers" width=30%>


**Ceramic Tweezers**:  While not strictly necessary, ceramic
tweezers are ideal for manipulating the small rectangles of tape used to insulate the tag test points.  These can be obtained inexpensively from Amazon.
</div>


<div class="clearfix">
<img src="/docs/userguides/fabrication/tools/images/scissors.png#floatright" alt="scissors" width=30%>


**Small Scissors**:  A pair of small, sharp scissors is essential for tag preparation.
</div>

**Tape Application Sticks** (4mm wooden coffee stirrers)
Wooden coffee stirrers are ideal for smoothing insulating tape while minimizing the potential for damage.

<img src="/docs/userguides/fabrication/tools/images/cord.png#floatright" alt="elastic cord" width=30%>

**Harness Material (elastic cord)**  1mm (or smaller) 
elastic cord is needed for building harnesses.  See
[leg harness section](/docs/userguides/legharness) for directions.

# Assembling Tags

The process of assembling tags includes soldering on batteries and applying insulation.  There are two types of insulation used -- the batteries are covered in 1mil kapton tape and, after soldering, the entire assembly is dipped into a urethane coating.

<div class="clearfix">
<img src="/docs/userguides/fabrication/tools/images/solderingstation.png#floatright" alt="soldering station" width=30%>

**Soldering Station** for the fine level assembly required it essential to use a high quality temperature controlled soldering iron with a fine-pitched tip.  In our lab we use the Hakko FX-951 soldering station with fine conical tips (e.g. 0.2mm T15-IL) for most work
</div>

<div class="clearfix">
<img src="/docs/userguides/fabrication/tools/images/boommicroscope.png#floatright" alt="soldering station" width=30%>

**Boom Microscope**  A microscope is not required for assembling tags, but is definitely helpful.  Ideally, this should be a microscope with zoom capability.


</div>

<div class="clearfix">
<img src="/docs/userguides/fabrication/tools/images/optivisor.png#floatright" alt="optivisor" width=30%>

**Optivisor** An optivisor is essential for the fine work necessary to assemble tags.  Be careful to request the ones with glass lenses !
</div>

<div class="clearfix">
<img src="/docs/userguides/fabrication/tools/images/solder.png#floatright" alt="solder" width=30%>

**Solder** A small diameter (e.g. 0.02 inch), leaded, flux core solder is essential.

</div>

<div class="clearfix">
<img src="/docs/userguides/fabrication/tools/images/flux.png#floatright" alt="flux" width=30%>

**Flux** in pen form is especially useful for soldering small components such as batteries.
</div>

<div class="clearfix">
<img src="/docs/userguides/fabrication/tools/images/fluxremover.png#floatright" alt="flux remover" width=30%>

** Flux Remover** After soldering, all components should be carefully cleaned with flux remover. 

</div>

<div  class="clearfix"><img  src="/docs/userguides/fabrication/tools/images/cottonswabs.png#floatright"  alt="cotton swabs"  width=30%> 

**Cotton Swabs** We use fine cotton swabs for this purpose.
</div>

<div class="clearfix">

**Kapton Tape**  Various widths of 1mil kapton tape are required for wrapping batteries (1/4", 3/8", 1/2") depending upon battery diameter.  Ideally the tape should be slightly wider than the battery.
</div>

<div  class="clearfix"><img  src="/docs/userguides/fabrication/tools/images/maskingtape.png#floatright"  alt="Masking Tape"  width=30%>

**Masking Taper**  During the coating process we use 6mm Scotch Masking Tape 233 to protect the contacts from the coating.  This is an automotive paint masking tape that bonds well, removes easily, and is compatible with various solvents.

</div>

<div  class="clearfix"><img  src="/docs/userguides/fabrication/tools/images/floralwire.png#floatright"  alt="FLoral Wire"  width=15%>

**Floral Wire**  We use 24 gauge floral wire to make disposable hangers for the tags for use during the coating process.  This is soft, easily bendable wire.

</div>

<div  class="clearfix"><img  src="/docs/userguides/fabrication/tools/images/xacto.png#floatright"  alt="xacto knife"  width=30%>


**xacto knife** An x-acto #1 is essential for cleaning excess coating material after coating tags.

</div>


<div  class="clearfix"><img  src="/docs/userguides/fabrication/tools/images/pinvise.png#floatright"  alt="pin vise"  width=30%>

**Pin Vise**  A pin vise with 1-1.1 mm drill is needed for cleaning the tag holes after coating
</div>

<div  class="clearfix"><img  src="/docs/userguides/fabrication/tools/images/dykes.png#floatright"  alt="diagonal cutters"  width=30%>

**Diagonal Cutters** A small pair of diagonal cutters is needed for forming the tag hangers for coating.
</div>

<div  class="clearfix"><img  src="images/needlenose.png#floatright"  alt="needle nose pliers"  width=30%>

**Needle Nose Pliers**  A small pair of needle nose pliers is needed for forming hangers.
</div>



<div  class="clearfix"><img  src="/docs/userguides/fabrication/tools/images/coating.png#floatright"  alt="Urethane Coating"  width=20%>

**MG 4223** We use MG Chemicals 4223 urethane coating for insulating the tags. This is available in a 55ml bottle. In practice we immerse the tags (with batteries) directly in the coating and hang them to dry.

# Assembly of Bases and Chargers

The assembly of bases and chargers requires the soldering tools described above (soldering station, microscope, solder, flux, flux remover).  In addition it is helpful to have tools to hold the various boards during assembly.
