Firmware for "real" and prototype tags.  Firmware is provided to two versions of BitTag, 
a BitTag emulator built using an ST Nucleo board, and several tag prototypes built using our
breakout base, daughter card, and sensor cards.

1. AccelTag -- firmware for an Accelerometer "tag" built using the tag-breakout-v2, steval-breakout-daughter and steval-mki179v1 (lis2dw12) breakout card
2. BitTagv5 -- firmware for bittags with rv8803 RTC
3. BitTagv6 -- firmware for bittags with rv3028 RTC
4. LuxTag   -- firmware for a light sensing tag with OPT3002 light sensor.  This uses the "tag-breakout-v2" with the steval-breakout-daughter card and custom OPT3002 board
5. NucleoTag -- firmware for BitTag running on an ST Nucleo L433RC-P board.  Modifications required to use real sensors
6. PresTag  -- firmware for a Pressure Sensor "tag" built using the tag-breakout-v2, steval-breakout-daughter and steval-mki213v1 (lps27) breakout card
